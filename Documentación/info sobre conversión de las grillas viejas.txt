So, you can migrate from Grid v3 to 6 with Delphi 7 IDE and then simply open your project with Delphi XE IDE.

I suggest that you upgrade your TdxDbGrid to TcxGrid v6 under Delphi 6 IDE and then migrate to the newest version with Delphi XE IDE.



In brief, you should perform the following steps to convert your current project:

1) Install both versions of the ExpressQuantumGrid (v3 and v6) for Delphi6;
2) Convert your old grid's layout to the latest product version (please refer to the "Converting to ExpressQuantumGrid" topic in the ExpressQuantumGrid's documentation to find more information on this subject);
3) Adjust your code to use the latest product version;
4) Install the latest version of the ExpressQuantumGrid (v6) for Delphi 2007;
5) Use the converted project in Delphi 2007.
