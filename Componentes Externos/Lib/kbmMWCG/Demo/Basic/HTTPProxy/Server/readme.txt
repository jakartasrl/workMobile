kbmMW HTTP Proxy server demo
-----------------------------

This project contains a demo server which is using a traditional
request/response transport to allow clients to access it.

The transport is configured to understand HTTP v1.1 streams,
and thus a client, using that streamformat, can access this applicationserver
optionally via a HTTP proxy server (web proxy).
