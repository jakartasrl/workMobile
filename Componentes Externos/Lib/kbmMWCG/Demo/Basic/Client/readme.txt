kbmMW Client demo
-----------------

This project contains a demo client which is using a traditional
request/response transport to communicate with an application server.

The demo can for example be used with the included BDE, DBISAM4 and NexusDB
application servers.

It shows how to make simple client to server calls, do simple database serverside and
client side database operations, and how to interact with the inventory service.
