 4.00.00 Dec 27 2011

        Important notes (changes that may break existing code)
        ======================================================
        * kbmMW Enterprise Edition Message Bundling require update of all nodes.

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added message bundling in WIB. To enable, send message with SubjectJeader.QoS value 
          KBMMW_TRANSPORT_QOS_BATCHABLE. To force a break between batchable messages, send a message
          with SubjectJeader.QoS KBMMW_TRANSPORT_QOS_PRIMARY_IF_BATCHED.
          PushMessage on queues now have optional argument AUnBatch:boolean=false which if set to true
          will automatically unbatch messages into singular messages on the queue.
          Only messages with equal priority, HopCount, Subject, Data property, MaxHopCount, Hops and Trace can
          be batched. By Setting MaxBatchedCount on SubjectHeader, you can determine how many messages of batchable
          type, can be batched into one.
        - Added Delphi XE2, C++Builder XE2 support.
        - Added support for Win32, Win64, MacOS.
        - Added Remote desktop components and samples for Win32 (not tested with Win64).
        - Added native full JSON support. Check new kbmMWJSON unit.
        - Added JSON dataset stream format. Check new kbmMWJSONStreamFormat unit.
        - Added Lazarus support. No wizard support at the moment.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed bug when requesting service from within same thread.

 3.52.00 Mar 5 2011

        Important notes (changes that may break existing code)
        ======================================================
        * kbmMW CodeGear Edition no longer supports ADO Express and
          DB Express due to compatibility with Delphi Standard Edition.
        * Changed TkbmMWDOMXML.SaveToStream in such way that AStreamBOM now
          is negated!!

        New stuff
        =========
        - Support for Delphi Standard Edition with kbmMW CodeGear Edition.
          It unfortunately means that kbmMW CodeGear Edition no longer supports
          ADO Express or DB Express, even for Delphi Professional and up.
          In case ADO Express or DB Express support is needed, its recommended to
          purchase kbmMW Professional Edition which contains full source and lots
          of database adapters.
        - Added new Call method to TkbmMWCustomClient and descendants for 
          doing service calls towards a server. A service call is a request
          to a service on a server, where no response is expected.
          Its only available for WIB based transports (kbmMW Ent Edition only).
        - Added abstraction layer IkbmMWCustomIPMessagingClientTransportInfo and
          IkbmMWCustomMessagingServerTransportInfo and made changes several places
          to use them. (kbmMW Ent Edition only)
        - Added TkbmMWMessageActionDispatcher and TkbmMWDispatchedMessageAction
          components for enabling easy use of messages to do internal 
          application eventing.
          Define a handler and subscribe for messages and anytime some thread 
          within the application decides to post a message that match the
          subscription, the handler is notified immediately. 
          See Dispatcher demo for example. (kbmMW Ent Edition only).
        - Added TkbmMWCircularBuffer to kbmMWDatastructures.pas.
        - Added TkbmMWBufferedStream to kbmMWDatastructures.pas. It enables high
          performance stream access which will improve performance significantly
          when dealing with for example file based streams.
        - Added ReadCacheSize,WriteCacheSize to TkbmMWFileStoreMessageQueue 
          to improve file queue performance significantly.(kbmMW Ent Edition only)
        - Added Checksummed:boolean and OnCalcChecksum properties to
          TkbmMWFileStoreMessageQueue.
          If Checksummed is set to true, MD5 (default if OnCalcChecksum 
          eventhandler is not provided) checksums are calculated for queue 
          header and queue body and included in the queue for dataverification.
          Until 256 bytes hashes can be used for checksum. 
          Notice that file queues created with this version cannot be read by 
          older kbmMW versions! Its legal to have a mix of messages that are
          checksummed and not in the same queue.  (kbmMW Ent Edition only)
        - Added Verify function returning true/false that verifies if a file 
          queue is structurally sound.
          If checksumming has been enabled for the messages, their checksum
          (default MD5) is also verified. (kbmMW Ent Edition only)
        - Added Repair function that does the same as verify, except it also
          automatically repairs illegal messages/queue segments by deletion
          of them after doing an intelligent scan for next valid 
          message/segment.  (kbmMW Ent Edition only)
        - Added OnRepair event to TkbmMWFileStoreMessageQueue to allow for 
          extraction of invalid queue data before deletion. 
          (kbmMW Ent Edition only)
        - Updated kbmMWStreamStore with new checksum/verify/repair functionality.
        - Added support for determining if OS version is Win7 in 
          kbmMWGetOSVersion in kbmMWGlobal.pas.
        - Added TkbmMWMD5Stream class to kbmMWGlobal.pas. It calculates MD5 
          on the fly by writing data to it like its a stream.
        - Added OnBeginUseConnectionPool and OnEndUseConnectionPool 
          to TkbmMWQueryService.
          It allows for on the fly provision of a connection pool 
          (for example from a pool of connection pools... for different databases 
           for example) on queryservice operations.
        - Added property encoding support to TkbmMWDOMXML.
        - Added NameSpaceByID and NameSpaceByURI to kbmMWXML.
        - Added several overloaded Add variants to TkbmMWDOMXML for adding xml nodes.
        - Added CheckNodeByName and CheckNodeByID to TkbmMWDOMXML. Its the same as
          NodeByName and NodeByID, except a "nice" exception is thrown in case the
          node wasnt found, and thus the method eases accessing node contents.
        - Added AddXMLDeclaration to TkbmMWDOMXML. It will create the standard
          ?xml declaration including encoding matching set encoding.
        - Added AddStandardNamespaces to TkbmMWDOMXML.

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Improved client connection/disconnection detection and handling.
        - Changed SaveToStream in such way that AStreamBOM now is negated!!
        - Changed TkbmMWCustomHashItem to operate on cardinal instead of longint.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed request thread pool cleanup upon shutdown.
        - Fixed blob support in kbmMWSQLite adapter.
        - Fixed bug in query service where permission for a clients provision 
          of key fields, was wrongly determined based on AllowClientStatement
          and not on AllowClientKeyFields.

 3.51.00 Oct 16 2010

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added sfDisplayWidth property to TkbmMWCustomBinaryStreamFormat.
          When set to sfLoadDetermineWidth, the formatter will automatically
          determine display widths of string/widestring fields during load.
        - Added new TkbmMWEventResolver that provides simple events for
          insert/update/delete operations. It can be used for resolving any dataset.
        - Added Query method in addition to Execute method on SQLite connection adapter.

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Finalized partial dataset streaming.
        - Split up old TkbmMWCustomResolver into base TkbmMWCustomResolver and
          TkbmMWCustomTableFieldResolver which assumes table/field knowledge.
        - Changed so shutting down a server messaing transport will wait until
          inbound and outbound processor threads have stopped until shutdown continues.
        - Dropped redefining parameters based on result from SQLite statement.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed 4 digit truncation issue with D7 and streaming ftFmtBCD field types
          for stream versions 25100 and older.
        - Fixed various compilation errors and minor bugs.


 3.50.01 Beta 2 Sep 5 2010

        Important notes (changes that may break existing code)
        ======================================================
        * Requires kbmMemTable v. 6.50.01!

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added support for Delphi XE, C++Builder XE, RAD Studio XE.
        - Added new database adapters for Devart's UniDAC and IBDAC, and DAsoft's AnyDAC.
          Specify {$DEFINE KBMMW_ANYDAC_SUPPORT}
                  {$DEFINE KBMMW_UNIDAC_SUPPORT}
                  {$DEFINE KBMMW_IBDAC_SUPPORT} in kbmMWConfig.inc to include support for those adapters.
        - Added SendPartialResultDataset method to TkbmMWCustomQueryService. Can be used for sending
          incremental resultsets back to client that has used AsyncOpen to open a server side dataset.
          Require kbmMW Enterprise Edition.
        - Added Synchronize methods to all message processors to allow for easy synchronization with
          main VCL thread.
        - Added support for ftOraBlob,ftOraClob,ftParadoxOle,ftDBaseOle field types
          in TkbmMWCustomBinaryStreamFormat.
        - Added support for sfDisplayWidth to optionally auto size displaywidth for
          string/sidestring fields.
	- Added CreateResponseMessage method to TkbmMWCustomMessagingServerTransport.
        - Added CreateTransportStream method to TkbmMWCustomTransport.
        - Added  function kbmMWGetTempDirectory:string;
                 function kbmMWGenerateUniqueFileName(const APrefix:string; const AExtension:string):string;
                 function kbmMWGenerateUniqueTempFileName(const APrefix:string; const AExtension:string):string;
          to kbmMWGlobal.pas.

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Improved kbmMWSQLite adapter.
        - Modified SetQueryResult to provide information about the type of the partial resultset:
          Can return: mwdpsAll if it was a complete resultset (not a partial resultset).
                      mwdpsInitial if it was the first part of a number of partial resultsets.
                      mwdpsData if its an inbetween part of partial resultsets.
                      mwdpsFinal if its the last part of a number of partial resultsets and
                        thus the resultset for the async query now is complete.
          procedure TForm1.kbmMWTCPIPIndyMessagingClientTransport1AsyncResponse(
            Sender: TObject; const TransportStream: IkbmMWCustomResponseTransportStream;
            const RequestID: Integer; const Result: Variant;
            UserStream: TkbmMWMemoryStream);
          var
            resMsg:IkbmMWCustomResponseTransportStream;
            iCode:integer;
          begin
            if not Supports(TransportStream,IkbmMWCustomResponseTransportStream,resMsg)
               exit;
            iCode:=resMsg.StatusCode;
            if ((RequestID == OriginalClientDataset.ActiveClient.LastRequestID) and (iCode=0)) then
               if OriginalClientDataset.SetQueryResult(Result,UserStream) in [mwdpsAll,mwdpsFinal] then
                  // Got a full resultset..
          end;

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed connection not released bug when RunInTransaction=false.
        - Fixed compilation bugs for D7 and D2007.


 3.50.00 Beta 1 Aug 5 2010

        Important notes (changes that may break existing code)
        ======================================================
        * Made several internal modifications to provide even better support for
          AutoFieldDefsOnOpen setting mwafoWithData, now even for master/detail
          relations. Several protected methods had their interfaces slightly changed.
          Example is the added parameter: ACallerMustFree to PerformQuery methods. Its value
          is default true, and means that the caller of PerformQuery is responsible
          of freeing the returned dataset.
        * Updated GetBestConnection to include an optional owner reference object.
          It can be Nil.
        * Added extra argument to OnGetNamedQuery event to identify in which situation
          the event is called.
        * Upped KBMMW_THREAD_TIMEOUT_GRANULARITY to 1000 (one sec). It may cause shutdown of
          applications to take a short while longer, but reduces significantly context switching
          in high load situations.
        * Renamed TkbmMWOnQueryStatementPlace to TkbmMWQueryOperationType.

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added new virtual database adapter MD (kbmMW Memory Dataset). Its providing
          an easier way to accessing a memory dataset that is defined either at
          designtime or at runtime. Its different to the MT adapter in the way that
          a TkbmMWMDQuery is not refering to a central memory table, but is instead
          used as is. Fields and or data can be predefined/put into the table before use
          for example at designtime or form create time, or can be defined on the fly
          at runtime via the events OnPerformFieldDefs and OnPerformQuery events.
          There is full support for parameters and query statement, that can be used
          by callers for custom use to indicate what information is requested.
          The connection pool will typically stay on the same service on which the
          TkbmMWMDQuery is placed, but can also be shared on a central datamodule/form.
          Sample code which use another query to provide field definitions and data.
              procedure TTestQuery.DYNAMICPerformFieldDefs(Sender: TObject;
                AParamsOnly: Boolean);
              begin
                 ALL_EVENTS.FetchDefinitions;
                 CopyFieldDefs(ALL_EVENTS.FieldDefs,DYNAMIC.FieldDefs);
              end;

              procedure TTestQuery.DYNAMICPerformQuery(Sender: TObject; var ACanCache,
                ACallerMustFree: Boolean; var ADataset: TDataSet);
              begin
                   ALL_EVENTS.Close;
                   ALL_EVENTS.Open;
                   ADataset:=ALL_EVENTS;
                   ACallerMustFree:=false;
              end;
          Its legal to populate the records manually and return nil for ADataset.
          Specify {$DEFINE KBMMW_MD_SUPPORT} in kbmMWConfig.inc to include.

        - Ent Edition only! Added AsyncOpen and SetQueryResult method to TkbmMWCustomClientCursor
          (and thus TkbmMWClientQuery and TkbmMWClientStoredProc).
          It can be used for requesting to open a server side dataset async instead of sync
          like a normal Open would do. When the resultset is ready, the
          OnAsyncResponse event of the client messaging transport will be called.
          To know that it was a response for a particular request, compare the
          request ids. When the correct dataset has been identified, use SetQueryResult
          to put result into the dataset.
          procedure TForm1.kbmMWTCPIPIndyMessagingClientTransport1AsyncResponse(
            Sender: TObject; const TransportStream: IkbmMWCustomResponseTransportStream;
            const RequestID: Integer; const Result: Variant;
            UserStream: TkbmMWMemoryStream);
          var
            resMsg:IkbmMWCustomResponseTransportStream;
            iCode:integer;
          begin
            if not Supports(TransportStream,IkbmMWCustomResponseTransportStream,resMsg)
               exit;
            iCode:=resMsg.StatusCode;
            if ((RequestID == OriginalClientDataset.ActiveClient.LastRequestID) and (iCode=0)) then
               OriginalClientDataset.SetQueryResult(Result,UserStream);
          end;
        - Added IsFieldNumeric method to TkbmMWCustomPooledDataset. Returns true if a TField
          is numeric, else false.
        - Added OnGetDefinitions, OnGetData, OnGetMoreData, OnExecute and OnGetMetaData events
          to the query service. It allows for easier access to providing access to
          runtime generated data. If the events return true, it is understood that
          the event has provided all data that needs to be returned to the client
          for that particular event. If the event returns false, standard
          processing will take place.
        - Added AsVariant property to TkbmMWVariantList. Returns/sets a variant array.
        - Added kbmMWFindFiles function to kbmMWGlobal.pas. Can search a specific directory
          recursively for files matching a specific search criteria.
        - Added PeerSubscribingFor method to server side messaging hub. It
          returns a list of spokes that subscribe for a specific subject.
        - Added TkbmMWLookupStreamStore for easy storing streams with a string key identifier in a streamstorage.

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Made several internal modifications to provide even better support for

          applications to take a short while longer, but reduces significantly context switching
          in high load situations.
        - Modified Disconnect method of TkbmMWCustomTCPIPIndyMessaging class to
          ensure disconnection.
        - Renamed TkbmMWOnQueryStatementPlace to TkbmMWQueryOperationType.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed compile bug in Apollo database adapter.
        - Fixed issue with TkbmMWClientTransactionResolver.Resolve not accepting open array of datasets.
        - Fixed bug where fielddefs were assigned but not copied to another dataset. Now using
          CopyFieldDefs global method defined in latest kbmMemTable.
        - Fixed issue when handling numeric data fields of non matching types. Ie.
          a resultset returns an ftFloat, but the resulting dataset had predefined
          a ftExtended field. This would under some circumstances previously fail.
        - Fixed TkbmMWCustomPooledMessageProcessor to correctly start n threads processing the messages.


 3.40.01 June 19 2010

        Important notes (changes that may break existing code)
        ======================================================
        * Removed use of dynamic instead of virtual definition for C++Builder
          due to the dynamic method definition now seemingly broken in the compiler
          while the virtual method definition that was broken in BCB 6, now seemingly
          works. That change also effectively results in drop of support of BCB 6!

	  define per subjectsubscription methods.
	- Added ExecuteSubscriptionEvents method to TkbmMWSubscriptionList. It will execute all relevant 
	  subject methods for all matching subscriptions for given message.
	- Added new method CreateMessage to TkbmMWCustomMessagingClientTransport and 
	  TkbmMWCustomMessagingServerTransport. It allows for creating message transport streams quickly.
	  A generated message created by CreateMessage can be directly pushed onto a queue.

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
	- Made Compare method in TkbmMWCustomRBTreeNodeKey public instead of protected.
	- Updated UIB adapter.

	- Fixed StreamSec SSH plugin.


 3.20.30 Nov 15 2009

        Important notes (changes that may break existing code)
        ======================================================
        * Transportstreamformat (STANDARD) has been upped to 320 to support
          more effecient streaming of integers of various types.
          Generally newer servers are detecting the version requested by a client
          and responds with the same version.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed Indy WIB issues.
        - Fixed threadnaming in D2010.
        - Fixed StreamFormat property editor in D2010.
        - Fixed a thread bug related to transport streams.
        - Fixed transportstream unstream/stream state bug related to threads.
        - Fixed Unicode issue in XML parser.

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Modified kbmMWStripReservedSubjectChars to also strip spaces.

        New stuff
        =========
        - Finished singlefile based, high performance TkbmMWFileStoreMessageQueue.
        - Finished kbmMWStreamStore.pas
        - Added new kbmMWDataStructures.pas unit. Contains support for
          binary search trees (TkbmMWCustomBinaryTree), and
          priority Red/Black trees (TkbmMWRBTree).
        - Changed TkbmMWMemoryStream to inherit directly from TStream instead of
          TCustomMemoryStream. Gives better performance and fixes some threading issues.
          Generally changed to use TkbmMWMemoryStream instead of TMemoryStream.
        - Added property AsArray to TkbmMWVariantList.
        - Improved result checking in kbmMWCustomTransport.pas for all I/O operations.


 3.20.10 beta 2 Sept 10 2009

        Important notes (changes that may break existing code)
        ======================================================
        * Major changes in transports, transport streams and transport info classes to utilize interfaces for 
          performance and leak avoidance reasons. This require changes to code where
          If you reference transportstreams in your code then you must updated the code to use the interface
          instead. Eg.
          IkbmMWCustomRequestTransportStream instead of TkbmMWCustomRequestTransportStream,
          IkbmMWCustomResponseTransportStream instead of TkbmMWCustomResponseTransportStream
          IkbmMWCustomTransportStream instead of TkbmMWCustomTransportStream
          Its very important that all relevant class references (T...) are replaced with interface references (I...)
            in all variable declarations and event handlers. If not, access violations will happen!
        * TkbmMWFileStoreMessageQueue is currently undergoing massive changes, and does not work in current release.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed NexusDB transport and ensured it supports NexusDB v3 along with v2.
	- Fixed OnDeliverySuccess event in WIB serverside transports to return correct number of successfully processed
          messages.
        - Fixed BeforeRead/AfterRead called out of true order for resultstreams.
        - Fixed OnDisconnect/OnConnect events on TkbmMWTCPIPIndyMessagingServerTransport.
        - Fixed kbmMW DOM XML unicode handling.
        - Partly rewrote TkbmMWCustomHashList to correctly distinguish between two hashed items that have same hashkey.
        - Fixed bug in TkbmMCustomSQLParamsResolver.DetermineParameterTypes which would set correct value if parameter had
          a datatype of ftBCD.


	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Changed to use Indy's TCPServer scheduling mechanism instead of own scheduling loop in 
          TkbmMWTCPIPIndyMessagingServerTransport.
        - Optimized Indy WIB TCP server side performance.
        - Added support for varUString (unicode variant strings) in TkbmMWCustomActionScriptService.
        - Added KBMMW_THREAD_TIMEOUT_GRANULARITY constant to kbmMWGlobal.pas which is the default thread timeout granularity.
        - Added Granularity property to TkbmMWCustomThread to allow for controlling the granularity of the thread work scheduler.
        - Added Thread property to TkbmMWCustomThread to gain access to the TkbmMWInnerThread class owned by the kbmMW thread class.
        - Added support on TkbmMWCustomThread.WaitWork to wait on a (optionally shared) custom event instead of the internal work event.
        - Added several new exception values to kbmMWExceptions.pas.
        - Added debug display of field attributes in kbmMWDebugDefs method.


        New stuff
        =========
        - Added D2010 support.
        - Added new kbmMWStreamStore.pas unit which contains foundation classes for storing streams of data along with optional
          metadata in a combined storage. Its possible to pull out, delete and add new streams to the storage.
          Ie. one file containing multiple streams. Its still undergoing testing and bughunting!
        - TkbmMWFileStoreMessageQueue is currently undergoing massive changes based on the new
          streamstore, and does not work in current release!
        - Major changes in transports, transport streams and transport info classes to utilize interfaces for 
          performance and leak avoidance reasons.
          If you reference transportstreams and transport info classes in your code then you must updated the
          code to use the interface instead. Eg.
          IkbmMWCustomRequestTransportStream instead of TkbmMWCustomRequestTransportStream,
          IkbmMWCustomResponseTransportStream instead of TkbmMWCustomResponseTransportStream
          IkbmMWCustomTransportStream instead of TkbmMWCustomTransportStream
        - Added TkbmMWSortedList to kbmMWGlobal.pas.


 3.20.00 beta July 28 2009
        Skipped v 3.10 to align with required kbmMemTable v 6.20.

        Important notes (changes that may break existing code)

        Fixes
        =====

        - Updated service allocation algorithms to improve stability and performance.
        - Fixed kbmMWCustomHTTPHelper.pas with regards to sending a file as a result in D2009.
        - Fixed mime encoding bug in kbmMWMime.pas
        - Fixed Indy9 client side bug.
        - Updated UIB adapter to solve blob bug.
        - Fixed thread leak in TkbmMWCustomThread.Stop.
        - Updated ODAC adapter to fix ORACLOB and ORABLOB issues.

          IkbmMWCustomTransportStream instead of TkbmMWCustomTransportStream
        - Similarly the object transfer mechanism has been changed to use interfaces. Methods like
          kbmMWObject2Variant and kbmMWVariant2Object has been removed. Instead make sure your custom objects
          have a full interface implementation, and when sending them, simply provide the interface instance
          as the argument (cli.Request(...,["Arg1",2,"Arg3",YourInterfaceInstance...]
          The receiving side must use:
            var 
              io:IYourObjectInterface;
            ...
             if Supports(Args[3],IYourObjectInterface,io) then
                GotYourInterfaceObject(io);
          Its very important that all relevant class references (T...) are replaced with interface references (I...)
            in all variable declarations and event handlers. If not, access violations will happen.
        - Added new AutoFieldDefsOnOpen setting: mwafWithData. If set, it will get the field definitions every
          time the query is run but only as part of the actual data transferred. Hence only one call is made to the
          database or app server. Notice that if the dataset is a detail table in a master/detail relationship, 2 
          calls will always be made (traditional style).
        - Added XML dataset stream formatter for kbmMemTable and kbmMW.
        - Added CurrencyAsDouble property to TkbmMWCustomStreamFormat and thus streamformatters as such. 
          Controls if currency values are streamed as currency or as double (64 bit) values.
        - Added ExtendedAsDouble property to TkbmMWCustomStreamFormat. Controls if extended (80 bit) 
          floating point values are streamed as extended or double (64 bit) values.
        - Updated binary dataset streamformat to 3.10. It now includes information about CurrencyAsDouble and 
          ExtendedAsDouble settings.
        - Added GrowOnIndex:boolean property to TkbmMWVariantList. If set to true and a variant is set via
          indexed reference, the list is automatically grown to include the given index. All automatically 
          added variants are null.
        - Added object boxing classes: TkbmMWvariantObject, TkbmMWStringObject, TkbmMWDoubleObject, 
          TkbmMWDateTimeObject and TkbmMWIntegerObject to kbmMWGlobal.pas.
        - Added TkbmMWAS3Object/IkbmMWAS3Object, TkbmMWAS3Array/IkbmMWAS3Array in new unit kbmMWAS3Utils.pas. 
          Purpose is to support ActionScript 3 objects and arrays (both dense indexed and associative) as arguments
          in calls to the app server from Flash/Flex/AIR clients. Supports true AMF3 format in addition to AMF0 in
          kbmMWAMF3TransStream.pas. If Flash/Flex/AIR client calls with format set to AMF0, a simple array of 
          simple (non object) arguments can be provided and a simple (non object) response returned.
          If set to AMF3 (default and recommended), complex requests including AS3 objects and arrays can be sent
          and returned. 
        - Several new native AS3 support functions and classes are available in kbmMWSpider including kbmMWConnection, 
          kbmMWQuery, kbmMWRequest, kbmMWResponse
          which allows for easy Flash/Flex/AIR query requests and regular simple requests.
        - Updated TkbmMWDOMXMLNode to contain many more attribute and value type getters and setters. Added CopyTo method.
          - Added GetAsDOM and GetAsXMLString functions to retrieve the node and subnodes as a new XML tree.
          - Added SetAsDOM, SetAsXMLString and SetAsXML functions to set the node and subnodes based on a different XML 
            document.
          - Added ChildByName, ChildByID to retrieve a childnode by name or ID.
        - Updated TkbmMWDOMXMLNodeList with more functions:
          - Added Add, Insert and CopyNodesTo methods to add new nodes to a list.
          - Added NodeByName and NodeByID to search for a specific node in the list based on name or ID.
        - Updated TkbmMWCustomDOMXMLParser/TkbmMWDOMXML:
          - Made it interface aware (IkbmMWCustomDOMXMLParser/IkbmMWDOMXML)
          - Added Typed property to control if streamed XML nodes have a type on them (xsi:string etc) or not.
          - Added SetNodeAsXML to copy in another node tree into this node.
        - Updated query service to support sending structure with data in one call.
        - Updated TkbmMWCustomServiceDefinition to refer to new TkbmMWServiceInstances class.


 3.01.00 Mar. 26 2009

        Fixes
        =====

        - Fixed potential thread suspension bug when thread is about to terminate.
        - Fixed UDP (and other non hub/spoke based) messaging transports (abstract error upon runtime).
        - Fixed minor stateID client side bug.

        New stuff
        =========
  
        - Added TkbmMWCustomActionScript service. It makes it possible to host ActionScript code
          serverside. The ActionScript 3 code must be compiled into a regular SWF, and referenced via
          the returned TkbmMWActionScriptServiceDefinition's SWFFile property.
          All functions that needs to be called from outside, must be exposed via the ExternalInterface
          callback mechanism in Adobe Flash/Flex.
          The TkbmMWCustomActionScript service also supports callbacks to
          other services on the app server, support streams (as base64 strings)
          support TkbmMWClientIdentity and more.
          Require Flash Player 10.0.36 or newer installed serverside.
        - Added WaitWorkDone to TkbmMWCustomThread which enables easy thread synchronization.
        - Added AutoReturnToThreadPool property to TkbmMWCustomThreadPool which controls if a thread
          automatically should be returned to the threadpool upon work done, or a manual
          ReturnToThreadPool call must be made.
        - Added a couple of global functions kbmMWGetCurrentThreadID and kbmMWGetCurrentThread.
        - Added support for client side fetch records on demand towards an application server.
          Notice that the accessed queryservice on the server must be declared stateful
          for fetch on demand to operate. If not an exception will be thrown.
          Notice that fetch on demand client resultsets will not be automatically cached client side.
         

 3.00.04 beta Dec. 30 2008

        Fixes
        =====

        - Fixed SOAP bug.
        - Fixed Indy server transport not releasing thread. Serious accumulating bug also
          affecting shutdown of application server!

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================

        - Updated JNI (for kbmMW Java service) to latest version.


 3.00.03 beta Dec. 30 2008

        Fixes
        =====

        - Fixed cross compatibility with non unicode development clients/servers for
          the STANDARD transport stream format family.

          The client by default always controls what the format the server should use for
          responding. The format is controlled of transportstreamformat version and options.
          options includes information about if the strings in the stream are to be understood
          as unicode or ansi.
          If a client requests with an older format than the server default use,
             it will get an older format response back.
          If a client requests with a newer format than the server default use,
             the server will throw an exception and the client typically be disconnected.
          If a client requests with a non unicode request (its compiled in D2007 or older IDEs)
             the server will return non unicode responses.
          If a client requests with a unicode request (its compiled with D2009 or newer)
             and the server is compiled with D2007 (or older) IDE, the server will throw an
             exception and the client is typically disconnected.
          Its possible to force a client to use a specific transport stream format by
             setting the transport parameter given with the constant string name
             KBMMW_STREAM_FORMATTER_PARAM_STREAMVERSION to a value of 100 (kbmMW v0.93+),
             101 (kbmMW v1.00 beta 2.2+), 102 (kbmMW v1.02+), 200 (kbmMW v2.00+),
             203 (kbmMW v2.03+), 250 (kbmMW v2.50+), 290 (kbmMW v2.90+), 300 (kbmMW v3.00+)
          Similarly its possible to force a client compiled with unicode support, to
             avoid using unicode for regular string values, by setting the transport parameter
             given with the constant string name KBMMW_STREAM_FORMATTER_PARAM_NOUNICODESTRINGS
             If set to any other value than an empty string, the client will be forced to
             send strings as ansistrings to be compatible with older servers.


 3.00.02 beta Dec. 29 2008

        Fixes
        =====

	- Fixed transport stream format issues introduced in 3.00.01.
	- Fixed UIB adapter. Requires UIB v. 2.1.


 3.00.01 beta Dec. 28 2008

        Important notes (changes that may break existing code)
        ======================================================
	* kbmMW v. 3.00 require kbmMemTable v. 6.00.
        * Dropped support for Delphi.Net as its a dead end product now.
	* Dropped support for Delphi 5.

        New stuff
        =========
	- Unicodified kbmMW to support Delphi 2009.
          Currently subjects (WIB) are still non unicode.
        - Dropped support for Delphi.Net as its a dead end product now.
	- Dropped support for Delphi 5.
        - Updated transport stream format to version 300 to support unicode.
          The server will detect clients using older stream format
          and adapt to it. Similarly its possible to force a client to use an older streamformat by setting the
          KBMMW_STREAM_FORMATTER_PARAM_STREAMVERSION transport parameter to the relevant version. Eg. 290

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Updated several methods in kbmMWGlobal.pas to handle TkbmMWBytes arrays in addition to regular buffer operations.
        - Added several Ansi specific methods: kbmMWAnsiTextToWord, kbmMWAnsiWordToText, kbmMWAnsiAddChar.
        - Updated kbmMWMime.pas to be unicode aware.
        - Added ReadAnsiString and WriteAnsiString functions to memorystreamformatters.

        Fixes
        =====

        - Fixed lack of garbage collection of connections/cache data in connectionpools.
        - Fixed backwards compatibility with older kbmMW clients.


 2.90.04 July 21 2008

        Important notes (changes that may break existing code)
        ======================================================

        * Changed to support (require) kbmMemTable v. 5.72. The change makes it alot easier to install
          kbmMW with kbmMemTable and kbmMemTable Pro Additions.

        New stuff
        =========

        - Added ADS DBF database adapter. Use {$DEFINE KBMMW_ADSDBF_SUPPORT} in kbmMWConfig.inc

        Fixes
        =====

        - Fixed 'unstream message' resulting in no response from server upon using early authentication.
        - Fixed cleanup of TkbmMWCustomServerRequestThread. Notice that FastMM can still claim bogus threads leaked.
          But careful inspection of the running threads during shutdown will show that the threads were actually stopped and
          disappeared from the threads window.
        - Fixed client side request/response messaging related single threaded apartment type applications.

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================

        - Changed to support (require) kbmMemTable v. 5.72. The change makes it alot easier to install
          kbmMW with kbmMemTable and kbmMemTable Pro Additions.
        - Updated NDB database adapter.
        - Updated SDAC database adapter.


 2.90.03 beta June 16 2008

        Fixes
        =====

        - Fixed some .Net warnings.
        - Fixed messaging thread leak.
        - Fixed obtaining cached resultset for a readonly dataset.
        - Fixed invalid parameternames in .Net.
        - Continued to improve TCPIP Indy client messaging transport stability.
        - Fixed HTTP stream helper to avoid overwriting parsed URL values. Resulted
          in AJAX tranport stream format not working since 2.90.
        - Fixed registering LastCommunication timestamp in transports.
        - Fixed shutdown of application server either slow or stalling.
        - Fixed issue with AMF3 transport stream format when combined multiple messages.

	
        Changes/minor additions
        =======================

        - Added streaming of Data property in TkbmMWFileStoreMessageQueue.
        - Fixed potential race condition issue in TkbmMWFileStoreMessageQueue.
        - Added mwdlIntermediate debuglevel to TkbmMWDebugLevel.
        - Added new global function: kbmMWDebugDumpVariantToString in kbmMWGlobal.pas
        - Added portable kbmMWGetModuleHInstance global method to kbmMWGlobal.pas
        - Modified OnIdle internal interval handling slightly.


        New stuff
        =========

	- Added 2 new cache flags: mwcfNoParamsInCacheID and mwcfIgnoreCachedParams.
          If mwcfNoParamsInCacheID is set, parameters wont be included in calculation of 
          cache ID, which means that the metadata/resultsets for two different parameter values
          for the same query will be considered the same.
          mwcfIgnoreCachedParams is currently not in use.
        - Added BCDOptions to TkbmMWCustomMetaData and descending classes.
          mwbcdParamKeyAsFloat specifies that key parameters should be set as float values
          rather than BCD or FmtBCD.
          mwbcdParamDataAsFloat specifies that data parametes should be set as float values
          rather than BCD or FmtBCD.
           

 2.90.02 beta May 5 2008

	Fixes
	=====

        - Fixed Delphi.Net support for Delphi 2007/.Net
        - Fixed OnIdle issues in TkbmMWCUstomTransport.
        - Fixed AMF3 reading double was reading twice.
        - Fixed endless recursion bug in TkbmMWHashBuckets.Delete (kbmMWGlobal.pas)

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================

        - Added more exception codes to kbmMWExceptions.pas. (mainly InControl Repository related)


 2.90.01 beta Apr 28 2008

	Fixes
	=====

        - Fixed bug in kbmMWClient.pas that ment that the server belived no
          message parts were sent in the request and thus ignored the request.
        - Fixed wrong EnsureMinimumConnections declaration in TkbmMWCustomConnectionPool.
          it should take no parameters.
        - Fixed exception handling issues due to changes in Indy 10.


 2.90.00 beta Apr 24 2008

        Important notes (changes that may break existing code)
        ======================================================

        * Changed streamformats to provide version number as an integer instead of a string.
        * Streamversion upped to 290. The transport stream header identifier has been modified
          to now instead be $0AAFFBCC due to changes in the streams header properties.
          The older identifier is recognized and respected to be compatible with older clients.
        * Prepared support for named persistent queues. Affects some methods like kbmMWGenerateMessageSubject
          that now require one additional argument. More importantly it affects the subscription
          subject format, why nodes relying on subscription announcements should be recompiled.

        New stuff
        =========

        - Added new designtime subscription list editor.
        - Prepared support for named persistent queues. Affects some methods like kbmMWGenerateMessageSubject
          that now require one additional argument. More importantly it affects the subscription
          subject format, why nodes relying on subscription announcements should be recompiled.
        - Added reference counting on transport streams. General rule is that when a transportstream
          is pushed on a queue, its out of user/developer scope. However if you need to use
          it after having it pushed on a queue, you can use the Use and DontUse methods of the
          transportstream/message to increment and decrement references to it. Use
          method FreeIfNotInUse to free the transportstream/message after use. Use IsInUse to
          detect if a message/transportstream is in use.
        - Added support for a request transportstream holding multiple subrequests and
          the response transportstream to hold multiple subresponses. Currently
          only used by AMF3 clients.
        - Added RollbackErrorCount:integer and Stalled:boolean properties to transportstreams.
          They are usually maintained by the queueing system to detect stalled messages.
        - Added OnIdle event, IdleInterval and LastCommunication properties to transports.
          They can be used to detect when a transport have been idle for a while, and
          then for example issue keep alive pings or the like. 
        - Added MoveTo, IsName and ChangeNamespace methods to TkbmMWDOMXMLNode.
        - Added Container:TkbmMWDOMXMLNodeList property to TkbmMWDOMXMLNode.
          Container indicates which container this node is owned by.
        - Added ReleaseNodes, AddNode, InsertNode, DeleteNode, MoveNodesTo methods to
          TkbmMWDOMXMLNodeList.
        - Added SearchNode, SearchRelNode, MoveNodes, MoveNode, SaveToFile, LoadFromFile to
          TkbmMWCustomDOMXMLParser.
        - Added new AMF3 streamformat. Its purpose is to allow Adobe Flex clients to access a kbmMW
          based application server directly. Most features are supported.
        - Added OnBeforeResolve, OnAfterResolve, OnBeforeSubResolve, OnAfterSubResolve events to
          TkbmMWClientTransactionResolver.
        - Added new property RollbackErrorCount to messages stored in messaging queues. It is used
          for tracking when a message is determined as being stalled by the queue management.
        - Added message stall detection to file and memory based message queues.
          A message is stalled when it has been rolled back (because of error) x number of times.
        - Added support for idle notification in TkbmMWCustomClient.
        - Massive changes due to new features in all WIB (message based) transports.
          - Message processors (based on TkbmMWCustomMessageProcessor)
          - Message queue processors (based on TkbmMWCustomMessageQueueProcessor)
            Generic queue based message processing can be extended from this one.
            It supports processing one message blocking or non blocking, all existing messages
            blocking or non blocking and continously also new messages until the processor
            is stopped.
          - Threadpooled message queue processors (based on TkbmMWCustomPooledMessageQueueProcessor)
            This one supports processing messages using threads from a thread pool.
          - Multithreaded shared or copied message delivery to spokes using threadpool.
          All messaging transports have been vastly changed to use message and messagequeue processors
          for inbound and outbound message handling.
        - Added OnRelayMessage to server messaging transports.
        - Added DeliveryMethod:TkbmMWMessagingHubDeliveryMethod, DeliveryThreadPoolSize:integer and
          DeliveryBatchSize:integer properties to hub messaging transports.
          DeliveryMethod can be set to: mwmhdmSingleThreaded, mwmhdmMultiThreadedShared
          or mwmhdmMultiThreadedCopied. SingleThreaded is similar to the old WIB hub delivery method
          used before 2.90. Its the fastest in terms of CPU cycles, but do not scale across
          CPU's/cores and the last spoke may potentially wait along time for its messages to arrive.
          Multithreaded use a thread pool to share the delivery to the spokes which each of them
          have an internal message queue. The difference between Multithreaded shared and copied,
          is that with shared, threads all refer to the original message, while copied ensures
          that each spoke gets a unique copy of the message. The later f.ex. opens up for that
          the message can be encrypted differently for each spoke in case that is required.
          DeliveryBatchSize determines a max for the number of messages delivered by a thread to
          a spoke, before it yield to another spoke. The higher number, the higher apparent performance
          but it should be balanced with the number of spokes, and the number of threads in the threadpool.
        - Added OnSetupSpokeOutQueue event to hub messaging transports. Its called when a spoke's private
          queue is to be setup. The queue class type is the same as the outbound queue defined for the
          transport, but alternative property settings can(should) be specified in this event.
        - Added IgnoreSubscriptions property to messaging transports. Allow for
          bypassing testing subjects for special cases or super high performance.
        - Added queue operation action notifiers that can be defined based on TkbmMWCustomMessageQueueAction,
          This way custom functionality can be hooked into the queues when things are happening
          on them.
        - Added StalledQueue:TkbmMWCustomMessageQueue and StalledTreshold:integer properties to
          TkbmMWCustomMessageQueue. They are used for detecting when a message is stalled, and
          optionally automatically move that message to a stalled queue for seperate handling.
        - Added Options:TkbmMWMessageQueueOptions to TkbmMWCustomMessageQueue. It controls how
          invalid or stalled messages should be handled.
        - Added OnStalledMessage event to TkbmMWCustomMessageQueue.
        - Added several new exception codes in kbmMWExceptions.pas
        - Added Synapse based TCPIP Hub and Spoke transports. 
        - Added TkbmMWLock class to kbmMWGlobal.pas. All kbmMW code now use TkbmMWLock instead
          of directly critical sections. TkbmMWLock optionally supports multireader exclusive writer
          type locking.
        - Added TkbmMWThreadList class to kbmMWGlobal.pas.
        - Added TkbmMWHashLongIntList, TkbmMWHashDoubleList, TkbmMWHashKeyValueList,
          TkbmMWHashWideKeyValueList hashlists in addition to TkbmMWHashStringList in
          kbmMWGlobal.pas.
        - Added TkbmMWCustomThread which is now used instead of TThread. It supports a much
          better threading scheme, scheduler and control, including participating in thread pools
          and thread naming.
        - Added TkbmMWSharedReadOnlyStream that provides multiple thread readonly access to a stream of
          data.
        - Added AssignVariant and IndexOf(AVariant) to TkbmMWVarlantList.
        - Added kbmMWDebugPrefix:string (global variable) in kbmMWGlobal. It can be set to
          prefix any debug text with an application specific text.
        - Added GetResponseSubscription to client messaging transports.
        - Added TkbmMWMessageQueueOptions AddOutstandingRequest and GetResponse to
          TkbmMWCustomSAFClientTransport.

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================

        - Modified kbmMWPooledFileClient to operate similarly to other pooled clients.
        - Changed streamformats to provide version number as an integer instead of a string.
        - Streamversion upped to 290. The transport stream header identifier has been modified
          to now instead be $0AAFFBCC due to changes in the streams header properties.
          The older identifier is recognized and respected to be compatible with older clients.
        - Changed the transport stream streamstate and unstreamstate to assist in the new transport
          stream sharing options.
        - Published StalledQueue, OnPushMessage, OnTentativelyMessagePop, OnCommitMessagePop,
          OnRollbackMessagePop, OnRejectMessage, OnDeleteMessage, OnStalledMessage events on
          TkbmMWFileStoreMessageQueue.
        - Rewamped TkbmMWSubscriptionList.
        - Changed TkbmMWCustomServiceDefinition.ReserveServiceInstance to use a slightly different
          algorithm.
        - Changed Service garbage collection algorithm to improve stability.

	Fixes
	=====

        - Fixed endless recursion issue in kbmMWDisposeVariantObject and kbmMWMarkVariantObjectForAutoDispose.
        - Fixed issues reg. ISAPI transport and VerifyTransfer.
        - Fixed naming of PGDAC database adapter.
        - Fixed TkbmMWCustomDOMXMLParser.SaveToStream (and thus other methods using it) to

        - Fixed HTTP response streamformat to respond using the same HTTP version as the request was
          given with.
        - Fixed TkbmMWCustomClient reconnect bug when OnException eventhandler not specified.
        - Fixed not assigning OnException event handler in TkbmMWCustomClient.Assign.
        - Fixed UpdateWhereAll bug in kbmMWMT adapter.
        - Fixed leak in TkbmMWFilePool when accessing nonexisting file.

 2.70.00 June 23 2007

        New stuff
        =========

        - Added support for Delphi 2007/win32.
        - Added new unit kbmMWHTTPUtils containing lots of web related functions:
            Cookie support:
               TkbmMWHTTPCookie, TkbmMWHTTPCookies,
               procedure kbmMWParseCookies(const ACookieHeader:string; ACookieList:TkbmMWHTTPCookies)
            Query string support:
              TkbmMWQueryValues
            Template support:
              kbmMWProcessTemplate
            Additional utility functions:
              function kbmMWEncodeEscapes(const AString:string):string
              function kbmMWDecodeEscapes(const AString:string):string
              function kbmMWRemoveQuotes(const AString:string):string
              function kbmMWHTMLToASCII(const AInput: string): string
              function kbmMWASCIIToHTML(const AInput: string): string
              function kbmMWURLToHTML(const AInput: string): string
              function kbmMWValueToHTML(const AName:string; const AValue:integer):string
              function kbmMWValueToCSS(const AName:string; const AValue:integer):string
              function kbmMWFindReplace(const AString,AFind,AReplace:string):string
              function kbmMWColorToHTML(const AColor:TColor):string
        - Added AJAX transport stream allowing for a kbmMW TCP/IP based transport to
          support a HTTP protocol compatible with normal web browsers.
          The transportstream supports requests containing XML according to kbmMW's XML layout
          and standard HTTP requests.
          In case a request was made using the XML format, the response will be XML formatted.
        - Added debug support for query, queryresult, definitions on the server.
          Changed the debugtypes to:
             TkbmMWDebugType = (mwdtTransport,mwdtService,mwdtServer,
                                mwdtDBDefs,mwdtDBMeta,mwdtDBResolve,
                                mwdtDBQuery,mwdtDBQueryResult);
             Notice that the old mwdtDataset debugtype is removed. For
             same functionality use mwdtDBResolve.
             mwdtDBQuery dumps information about queries about to happen or being executed.
             mwdtQueryResult dumps information about the resultset from an opened query.
             mwdtDBDefs dumps information about field/parameter definition requests.
        - Added kbmMWDebugLock/kbmMWDebugUnlock functionality to ensure that debug calls are threadsafe.
             kbmMW's own debug functions use these lock/unlock methods now.
        - Added new TkbmMWStringBuilder class for effeciently appending data to a string.
          It is semantically compatible with .Net's StringBuilder class.
        - Added new functions to kbmMWGlobal:
             function kbmMWSafeString(AString:string):string
               Ensures that a string is 'safe' when used in a SQL statement. Its to be used to
               avoid SQL injection when an SQL string is build, including userinput.
             procedure kbmMWExplode(AString:string; ADelimiter:char; AList:TStrings; const AStrict:boolean = true)
               Explodes a string containing elements seperated by ADelimiter into a list.
               If AString is true, it will drop any ADelimiter chars preceding the elements.
             function kbmMWImplode(AList:TStrings; ADelimiter:string):string
               Implodes a number of strings into elements of a string each delimited by ADelimiter.
        - Added TkbmMWCustomHTTPService, TkbmMWEventHTTPService and TkbmMWHTTPServiceDefinition.
          Allows for building a service that makes the kbmMW application server act as a Web server.
          Multiple services can be added for each their own subdomain.
          Default functionality for TkbmMWCustomHTTPService is to provide files requested by GET as a regular
          webserver.
          TkbmMWEventHTTPService publishes events for GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and CONNECT web calls.
          Paths to relevant files can be specified in the returned TkbmMWHTTPServiceDefinition.
             The following file groups can currently have individual paths:
                mwhfcHTML,mwhfcStyleSheet,mwhfcJavascript,mwhfcImage,mwhfcOther
          A large number of file types are automatically identified with mimetypes.
          Additional mimetypes can be specified using the MimeTypes property at runtime.
          OnFileAccess and OnFileMapPath events can be used to control file access.
          Removed reference to Forms in kbmMWServer.pas for D7 and up compilers.
        - Added exception handling when closing listener threads down.
        - Added identification of transports (server or client).
        - Added support for opening a query in a specific transactions serverside:
                TkbmMWCustomPooledCursor.OpenInTransaction
        - Added TkbmMWCustomPooledCursor.IsDefaultTransaction property.
          Added several new dataset debug functions to kbmMWCustomDataset.pas:
             procedure kbmMWDebugDumpParams(ALevel:TkbmMWDebugLevel; 
                                            AType:TkbmMWDebugType; 
                                            AWhere:TkbmMWDebugDump; 
                                            AMessage:string; 
                                            AParams:TParams)
             procedure kbmMWDebugDumpQuery(ALevel:TkbmMWDebugLevel; 
                                           AWhere:TkbmMWDebugDump; AMessage:string; 
                                           ACursor:TkbmMWCustomPooledCursor)
             procedure kbmMWDebugDumpQueryResult(ALevel:TkbmMWDebugLevel; 
                                                 AWhere:TkbmMWDebugDump; AMessage:string; 
                                                 ACursor:TkbmMWCustomPooledCursor; AResult:TDataset)
             procedure kbmMWDebugDumpDefs(ALevel:TkbmMWDebugLevel; 
                                          AWhere:TkbmMWDebugDump; 
                                          AMessage:string; 
                                          ACursor:TkbmMWCustomPooledCursor)
             procedure kbmMWDebugDumpResolveSQLOperation(ALevel:TkbmMWDebugLevel; 
                                                         AWhere:TkbmMWDebugDump; 
                                                         AMessage:string; 
                                                         AObject:TkbmMWCustomSQLResolverObject)
        - Added support for dumping arguments for call when enabling transport debug.
        - Added OnValidateSubscription event to hub messaging transports. Allows for 
            ignoring a spokes wish to subscribe for specific subjects.
        - Expanded TkbmMWHTTPTransportStreamHelper with lots of new functionality, like:
            property Headers:TStringList
            property Operation:string
            property URL:string
            property Query:string
            property MimeType:string
            property ActiveMimeType:string
            property MaxHeaderSize:integer
            property ProxyUserName:string
            property ProxyPassword:string
            property HTTPVersion:string
            property HTTPHost:string
            property ContentLength:integer
            function HTTPStatusCodeFromServerStatusCode(const AServerStatusCode:integer):integer;
            function HTTPStatusTextFromCode(const ACode:integer):string;
            procedure HTTPGetContents;
            function HTTPBuildPostHeader(const AVerificationHeader:string):string;
            function HTTPBuildOKResponseHeader(const AVerificationHeader:string; ASize:integer = -1):string;
            function HTTPBuildCustomResponseHeader(const AVerificationHeader:string; 
                                                   const AContentLength:integer; 
                                                   const AHTTPStatusCode:integer;

        Important notes
        ===============
        * The TkbmMWBinaryTransportStream version has been upped to v.25100 due to 
          changes in its format to handle TFMTBCD fields better. Because of that
          the server _must_ be recompiled. Older clients may optionally be
          recompiled.

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added FinalizeObject and FinalizeObjects methods to TkbmMWCustomResolver.
        - Changed resolver operation to detect original NULL key field values. It will use the
          gained knowledge to generate new SQK statenents in the fly, when needed, with the
          relevant WHERE clause supporting updating WHERE somefield IS NULL...
        - Added AutoFieldOrigin property to all dataset components.

        =====
        - Fixed Synapse UDP messaging compile error.
        - Fixed TkbmMWPooledSimpleClient and descendants giving A/V when calling Connect.
          In reality Connect and disconnect should do nothing because the connections are
          obtained from a connection pool which itself manages the status of the connections.
        - Fixed FIB adapter compilation for Delphi 5 and added missing Unidirectional definition
          in PerformQuery.

 2.03.04

 	Changes/minor additions
        =======================

          If equal or older it will gracefully be handled.
        - Added support for KBMMWPROXYUSERNAME and KBMMWPROXYPASSWORD HTTP transport stream format parameters.
          Can be set to get through an HTTP proxy which require Basic authentication.
        - Updated DBISAM4 adapter to compile with DBISAM v. 4.09. The adapter will still
          be compatible with DBISAM v.4.01+.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed compile errors when KBMMW_MESSAGING_SUPPORT is disabled.
        - Fixed statehandling which broke in 2.01 and later due to optimizations of service instance allocation.


 2.03.03

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added support for KBMMW_CONSOLE_SUPPORT definition. Ensures that kbmMW runtime do not
          require any Forms/QForms packages, and thus allows for execution under Linux as a console app.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed Kylix3 installation.
        - Fixed A/V on Indy messaging transport destruction.
        - Published ClusterID on all messaging transports.

        - Fixed closing messaging transport when inbound or outbound messagequeue is removed.


 2.03   23. July 2004

        Important notes
        ===============
        * Updated general transport stream to 203 to support new Sync value. Should be backwards compatible.
        * Standard message subject formats changed from REQ.> to REQ.ClusterID.> etc.
        * OnSubscription and OnUnsubscription events have been getting an extra ClusterID argument.
        * Added support for KBMMW_MESSAGING_SUPPORT definition. Existing customers should remember to
          define it in the kbmMWConfig.inc file to be able to use messaging capabilities.

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added ClusterID to all transports. Its specially interesting on messaging where it allows to easily divide the
          WIB into several logical WIBS each running their own set of applications. Notice this has changed the
          standard message subject formats from REQ.> to REQ.ClusterID.> etc.
        - Added AsyncRequest, SendAsyncRequest and SendAsyncRequestEx to simpleclient.
        - Added OnAsyncResponse to client messaging transports.
        - Added DeleteServer, DeleteServerByID, SetServers methods to TkbmMWLoadBalancedServerList.
        - Added MaxConnectFailed property to loadbalancer components. It will together with new TkbmMWLoadBalancingNonConnectableOption
          value mwlbnoDiscardAtConnectFailLimit discard servers who have been failing too many times.
        - Added support for KBMMW_CONSOLE_SUPPORT for Kylix in kbmMWConfig.inc. If defined, kbmMW based applications
          will run fine without any X server installed. Notice that any debug dialogs will instead be routed to
          the syslog.
          

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Modified REQ and RES subjects to add an extra part which can be SYNC or ASYNC.
          If the part is not specified, its considered SYNC.
        - Updated general transport stream to 203 to support new Sync value.
          Backwards compatible.
        - OnSubscription and OnUnsubscription events have been getting an extra ClusterID argument.
        - Made Servers property public on TkbmMWCustomLoadbalancer.
        - Changed to not use Suspend/Resume internally while threads are running in messaging transports.
          Instead relevant threads are created and destroyed when needed.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed Params in BCB6.
        - Fixed service wizard emitting GetServiceDefinition method for BCB even if relevant checkbox wasnt checked.
        - Fixed Indy TCPIP messaging spoke client workthread.

 2.02   11. July 2004

        Important notes
        ===============
        * The transport parameter setting KBMMWDISCONNECTAFTERRESPONSE has been discontinued.
        * Updated kbmMW.wsdl file. Stubs generated from old file needs to be regenerated.

        New stuff
        =========
        - DOM based SOAP for requests/responses implemented.
        - Added Compression property to transports which can be used to add a custom compression to a transport.
          Notice that the streamformat may overrule the compression setting (eg. ZIPPED etc).
        - Added TkbmMWMemoryStream which is an optimized version of TMemoryStream.
          Its automatically used in many places in kbmMW if the line:
            {$DEFINE KBMMW_OPTIMIZED_MEMORYSTREAM}
          is defined in kbmMWConfig.inc.
          It will dramatically improve performance on moving large amounts of data within kbmMW.

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Added TransportStateOptions to stateful non messaging transports like Indy TCPIP.
             mwtsoDisconnectAfterResponse instructs kbmMW to disconnect a client after it has been served its response.
             This option means that the previous transport parameter setting KBMMWDISCONNECTAFTERRESPONSE has been discontinued.
             mwtsoReadUntilDisconnect instructs kbmMW to not expect a request size header, but read until the client disconnects
             to gather a complete request. Rarely needed as its not possible to respond back to the client on the same socket.
        - Altered percentage calculation for GetStreamEx and PutStreamEx to handle super large files.
        - Updated kbmMW.wsdl file.
        - Published OnRelayMessage on Indy UDP server messaging transport.
        - Added support for copying RequestAttributes when using a simpleclient as a template.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed unlocking reference after freeing in file pool garbage collection.
        - Fixed detecting unused file references in file pool garbage collection.
        - Fixed messaging and encryption problem.
        - Fixed UIB adapter to compile under D5.
        - Fixed slow shutdown when min instances specified on services.
        - Fixed hanging messaging client if transport wasnt deactivated.
        - Fixed setting transports on cloned transportstreams before delivering from messaging system.
        - Fixed property warnings for D5/D6 on a couple of designtime forms.
        - Added RenameFile/RenameFileEx and SetFileStat/SetFileStatEx methods to file client and service.
        - Fixed SetFileStat in file client.


 2.01a  13. June 2004

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Added new events to all TkbmMWCustomClient descendants:
             OnClientRequest - called before any request operation is happening.
             OnClientResponse - classed after the response for a request have been receive and parsed.
             OnClientTransmit - called after the request transport stream have been prepared.
             OnClientReceive - called before right after the client have reseived and parsed the response transport stream.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed Null handling in Absolute Database adapter.
        - Fixed operation of ZIPPED streamformat with messaging.

 2.01 31. May 2004

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added Hub/Spoke messaging support.
        - Added support for single endpoint and multi endpoint message deliveries.
        - Added TCPIP Indy messaging.
        - Added Message action component.
        - Added automatic message relay options to all messaging transports.
        - Added automatic message gateway options to all messaging transports.
        - Added support for retrieving directory structure only in fileclient/service.
          Notice extra argument (DirsOnly:boolean) added to ListFiles/ListFilesEx method.
        - Added several new global functions:
            kbmMWCreateGUID, kbmMWGenerateUniqueNodeID, kbmMWGenerateResponseSubscriptionSubject,
            kbmMWExtractParameter, kbmMWQuoteString,
        - Added Apollo database adapter (VistaSoft).
        - Added Absolute Database Engine adapter (ComponentAce).
        - Added support for singleton message transports. Ie transports who are used directly and
          not replicated within the connection pool.
        - Added support for using blobs as parameters.
        - Added negated subscriptions. I.e. a particular subject you definitely dont want to receive.
          Start subscription with !. Remember that the order of subscriptions determine what override what.

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Improved wizard looks in K3.
        - Changed wizard forms not to scale.
        - Improved simpleclient (and thus all descendends of it) with regards to automatic generation
          of node ID, activation, async request/response message handling.
        - Virtualized several setter methods on TkbmMWCustomTransport.

        Fixes
        =====
   	- Fixed DB wizard output.
        - Fixed IBX5 adapter with regards to limited transaction handling.
        - Fixed IBX5 adapter's description to behave nicely in service wizard.
        - Fixed compilation bugs in K3.
        - Fixed Null parameter bug in UIB.
        - Fixed problem requesting non existing service name.
        - Fixed resolving joins.
        - Fixed D5 compilation.
        - Fixed StrSecII byteswap problem.
        - Fixed having ; in parameter values.


 2.01 beta 2 8. Mar. 2004

        Important notes
        ===============
        * Fixed several severe bugs introduced in 2.01 beta 1. Upgrade highly recommended!

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Optimized service instance and connection allocation algorithms to
          ensure more level distribution.
        - Added ConnectionList property to TkbmMWCustomConnectionPool to give access to allocated
          connections (and thus their statistics) in the connectionpool.
        - Optimized several internals.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed bug in loadbalancing service referencing wrong list.
        - Fixed FreeNotification leaks in all units.
        - Fixed several severe bugs introduced in 2.01 beta 1. Upgrade highly recommended!


 2.01 beta 1 29. Feb. 2004

        Important notes
        ===============
        * Added new StringConversion property to client and server transports.
          Default mwscFixed (breaks backwards compatibility with clients and servers!!!)
          When set to fixed all date/time and float to string conversion and back will
          be handled by kbmMW in a safe consistent format which is generally not influenced by
          locale settings. Its specially of interest for pre D7 developers.
          To keep backwards compatibility, please set the property to mwscLocale,
          or add the following string to kbmMWConfig.inc and recompile:
          {$DEFINE KBMMW_V200_COMPAT_STRINGCONVERSION}
        * Changed XML dateformat conversion to follow XML standard layout: YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.NNN
        * GetBestConnection _automatically_ locks the connection. Thus dont lock it again, just
          unlockconnection after use.
        * Notice that SOAP DOM implementation in this release is still not complete.

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added SOAP transport stream. For operates directly with ISAPI transport.
          To use it in combination with other transports, one must select if the
          streamformat operates via the HTTP protocol (default false).
          To specify that it is used over the HTTP protocol, add a transport parameter:
             KBMMWSOAPVIAHTTP=1
          Like with the HTTP streamformat, the SOAP format via HTTP allow for using a proxy server
          by setting the KBMMWHTTPPOSTURL parameter.
        - Added new MimeType property for all transport streams. Default value is 'application/octet-stream'.
          For SOAP and XML transports its default 'text/xml'.
        - Added mimetype override parameter to SOAP and HTTP formats.
          Override by setting transport parameter KBMMWMIMETYPE=some_other_mimetype
        - Added general transport parameter: KBMMWDISCONNECTAFTERRESPONSEDELIVERY which can be set
          to 1 to force a close of the connection after response delivery.
          Specially interesting when a kbmMW app server should mimic a webservice/webserver.
        - Added new StringConversion property to client and server transports.
          Default mwscFixed (breaks backwards compatibility with clients and servers!!!)
          When set to fixed all date/time and float to string conversion and back will
          be handled by kbmMW in a safe consistent format which is generally not influenced by
          locale settings. Its specially of interest for pre D7 developers.
          To keep backwards compatibility, please set the property to mwscLocale,
          or add the following string to kbmMWConfig.inc and recompile:
          {$DEFINE KBMMW_V200_COMPAT_STRINGCONVERSION}

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Performance optimized UIB adapter and fixed with regards to RowsAffected after execsql.
          Now UIB is seriously fast... much faster than IBO.
        - Performance optimized kbmMW's resolving process. Initial preparation for each resolve call
          now takes approx. 1/3 the time compared to 2.00.
        - Optimized not removing a cached entry after resolve, but only the dataset related to it.
          Its done like this to further optimize the resolve speed to avoid repeatedly fetching new
          field defs from the database.
        - Changed XML dateformat conversion to follow XML standard layout: YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.NNN
        - Added support for automatic deletion of partially received files on server side
          at garbage collection by setting the TkbmMWFileServiceDefinition.KeepPartialFileOnFailure
          to true.
        - GetBestConnection _automatically_ locks the connection. Thus dont lock it again, just
          unlockconnection after use.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed compilation of ODAC4 and MyDAC adapters.
        - Fixed wrongfull commit of transaction in finalizeresolve method of the IBX5 resolver.
        - Fixed serious clienttransaction resolver bug which would result in wrongfully continuing resolving
          and commiting updates regardless of a dataset fails being resolved.
        - Fixed XML bug with symbols/tags longer than 255 bytes.
        - Fixed bug with stored procedures and parameters in the cross adapter.
        - Fixed A/V when shutting app server down due to stats garbagecollect.
        - Fixed bug not allowing for inserting values in keyfields if updatekeyfields was false.
        - Fixed bug not checking for nil in kbmMWBinaryStreamFormat.
        - Fixed missing check in fileservice PUT operation.

 2.00 Final  12. Jan. 2004

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added OnRequestTimeout event to TkbmMWServer and TkbmMWCustomService.
          Its triggered during a garbage collection sweep if the service definition Timeout property
          is > 0 and the current request has been running for more than Timeout secs.
          First the service's own event is called (to allow it to clean up or potentially overrule
          automatic shutdown of the service instance).
          Then the servers event is called which may choose to override what the has been decided
          in the service.

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
        - Added support for ftFMTBCD fields in query service and binary dataset stream format.
        - Added full transaction support for InternalInitFieldDefs the same way as for populate and execute.
          Should solve IB transactions being left over at occations.

        Fixes
        =====
        - Fixed range check error in subject helper functions in kbmMWGlobal.pas
        - Fixed TkbmMWFileClient when transferring files of zero size.
        - Fixed problem with not getting data when query statement empty (easily seen with MT adapter)
        - Fixed A/V due to client/server serving thread or delivery thread running while
          message queue is destroyed during app. close and deletion of a messagequeue while
          transport active.

 2.00 Gold 1  29. Dec. 2003

        PLEASE NOTICE THAT v2 CONTAINS NUMEROUS INTERNAL CHANGES NOT MENTIONED HERE

        Important notes
        ===============
	* Transport stream format changed. New format clients wont work agains old format servers,
	  however new format servers support old format clients.
	* Changed setting the StoredProcName only to fetch fielddefs at designtime.
	  At runtime will require you to manually FetchDefinitions.
	* OnResolveError event parameters added. Will require updating your source.
	* Moved lots of properties from the resolver components to the new meta data components.
	  Notice its important to add a matching metadata component to the form on which the 
	  connection pool is placed. Hook up the metadata component to the MetaData property of
	  the connection pool.

        New stuff
        =========
	- Severely reworked internal transport class structures.
	- Added TkbmMWCustomTransportController, TkbmMWCustomTransportStreamFormatter
	  and inherited components matching existing transports.
	- Added advanced publish/subscribe messenging support via a completely new
	  SAF (Store and Forward) buffered framework.
	- Added fragmented package messenging support.
	- Added TkbmMWPooledFileClient which operates through a client connectionpool.
	- Added TkbmMWPooledInventoryClient.
	- Added support for multiple statements in same query/stored procedure.
	  To seperate a statement from the next, the line _must_ start with either ! or =
	  = indicates that the statement is the statement that will return a resultset.
	  Only one resultset statement is allowed in a multiple statement.
	  All statements are automatically run in the same tranaaction.
	- Updated service wizard to handle service oriented wizard plugins.
	- Added unicode support in transports, datasets and more.
	- Added TkbmMWUnicodeOptions (mwucAutoUTF8,mwucStringsAsUnicode) to metadata components.
	  mwucAutoUTF8 will if set ensure that all widestring fields are converted from/to UTF8 on
	  storage/retrieval. mwucStringsAsUnicode will automatically make ftString and ftWideChar
	  from backend storage to ftWidestring for all kbmMW related operations.
	  mwucAutoParamUTF8 which will convert ftwidestring param datatype to ftString
	  and automatically convert the unicode data to an UTF8 encoded string.
	- Added true request/response support through messaging.
	- Added subscription announcement features to client and server transports:
	    procedure AnnounceSubscriptions;
	  and event:
	    OnSubscription and OnUnsubscription
	- Added preliminary support for Cache and Throttle messages. No logic yet,
	  but the framework will accept them.
	- Added several global functions for generating subjects and extracting
	  information from them.
	- Added superfast XML transport stream format. (Add kbmMWXMLTransStream to the uses clause).
	  Define KBMMW_XML_TRANSPORTSTREAM_SUPPORT in kbmMWConfig.inc to enable XML support.
	- Added DBISAM4 support with support for remote procedures via the standard
	  kbmMW stored procedure support.
	  Define KBMMW_DBISAM4_SUPPORT in kbmMWConfig.inc for DBISAM 4.01+ support.
	- Added Synapse TCPIP transport. Download Synapse from http:  www.ararat.cz/synapse/
	- Added Synapse UDP messaging transport.
	- Added a couple of debug placement values: mwddOneTextFile and mwddOneRawFile.
	  Dumps in same format as mwddTextFile and mwddRawFile, but always appends to the same
	  file given via the global string variable kbmMWDebugFile. Default 'kbmMW_Debug.log'.
	- Added UndoByRecordID(ARecordID:integer):boolean function to TkbmMWCustomPooledDataset.
	  Will allow undoing a change on a record based on the recordID.
	  Thus the record do not need to be in the current index to be undone.
	- Added new Metadata components which should be placed centrally together with the connection pool.
	  The metadata component now contain lots of the property settings earlier placed on the resolver,
	  and contains functionality for manipulating tables, indexes and sequences.
	  Currently the following metadata components are supported: TkbmMWNullMetaData, TkbmMWGenericSQLMetaData,
	  TkbmMWOracleMetaData, TkbmMWInterbaseMetaData, TkbmMWDBISAM3MetaData, TkbmMWDBISAM4MetaData,
	  TkbmMWNexusMetaData.
	- Added new sequence handling system on the server side.
	  The sequence handling system is designed for obtaining unique numbers in a database independant way.
	  If the database supports sequences or generators, those will be used. If not a special pivot table
	  will automatically be created.
	  A sequence is obtained by a sequence name which the developer choose. Multiple sequences can be handled
	  simultaniously. Two sequence components are bundled: TkbmMWTemporarySequencer and TkbmMWDatastoreSequencer.
	  Temporary sequencer operates in memory only (the internal pivot tables can be stored and reloaded if needed).
	  Datastore sequencer operates directly against a datastore using the abilities of the datastore if possible, else
	  automatically operating a pivot table.

	Changes/minor additions
        =======================
	- Added proper support for AutoReleaseConnections in TkbmMWTransaction.
	- Added Subject property to TkbmMWCustomTransportStream.
	- Altered virtual to dynamic for C++Builder only for public developer access methods in kbmMWCustomDataset.
	- Altered property order for QueryService and QueryServiceVersion in TkbmMWClientQuery and TkbmMWClientStoredProc.
	- Modified strategy for resolver exception handling. If OnResolveError is specified, it will always be used
	  and no exceptions are raised. If its not specified, an exception is raised on resolve error.
	- Updated all database adapters (except NexusDB, DBISAM3, X, MT and FF2) to allow for RowsAffected/RecordsAffected=-1
	  Usually it means that an exception has been thrown which is handled anyway by kbmMW.
	  But in rare cases some databases can be set to not report back the number of rows affected
	  even if an operation went well, and would then return -1.
	- Changed setting the StoredProcName only to fetch fielddefs at designtime.
	  At runtime will require you to manually FetchDefinitions.
	- Changing to allow for raising exception after resolve only if OnResolveError is not set.
	- Improved M/D relation handling on client side to prevent refreshing detail unless
	  master/detail keyfields has changed.
	- Generally improved M/D which fix some bugs and improves performance.
	- Published several properties on the TkbmMWClientBriefcaseStreamFormat component.
	- Added UpdateMacros method to TkbmMWCustomConnectionPool which is controlled by
	  new property AutoUpdateMacros. If true, UpdateMacros is called automatically when
	  the connectionpool is activated. Added OnUpdateMacros event which is called when
	  UpdateMacros is called.
	- Added Target argument to SendMessage. If empty will broadcast, otherwise will target
	  to the node specified in the target string which is formatted as a connectionstring.
	  eg. for UDP messaging: IP=someip;PORT=someportno
	  If parts of the target is missing, the default send values from the transport are used.
	- Made using a resolver during resolving threadsafe (protected by locking/unlocking).
	- Updated ZEOS6 adapter to support stored procedures and fix some bugs (Roger Nyberg).
	- Updated custom transports, client and server to handle stream envelopes.
	- Updated Populate to surround opening a cursor with transaction handling.
	- Updated StreamSec Plugin to match latest StreamSec release.
	- Updated NexusDB MetaData to use dblquotes instead of single.
	- Added RecordID and Current arguments to OnResolveError event.
	  Current is true if the current record is the one pointed to by RecordID, else false.

        Fixes
        =====
	- Fixed tedious bug with C++Builder which do not handle virtual definitions correctly.
	- Changed ThreadSessionName from being published to being public only.
	- Fixed 'Record not found' exception during ProcessErrorTable in certain circumstances.
	- Fixed checking for if ServerTransport given before use in TkbmMWLocalClientTransport.
	- Fixed copying Null parameter in CopyParamsValueAndType.
	- Fixed macros not being expanded around fetching definitions.
	- Generally improved/fixed bugs returning exceptions to client.
	- Fixed problem when ftTime/ftDate and ftDateTime values =0 would result in null value.
	- Added check for transport set on client connection pool to avoid AV.
	- Fixing handling of exceptions during definition fetching when opening a dataset
	  to allow for more correct message to appear at caller.
	- Fixed specifying stored procedure names.
	- Fixed resetting IsDataChanged and checkpointing when no error. Solves
	  problems when resolving twice.
	- Published SQL property in ZEOS6 adapter.
	- Fixed missing registration of DBISAM4 components.
	- Fixing D6 and D5 compatibility.
	- Fixed several minor errors found in v1.
	- Fixed Kylix3 and C++Builder 6 compatibility.

        Important notes
        ===============
        * Moved ErrorTable from resolver to TkbmMWCustomPooledCursor.
        * Removed keyfields from errortable. They are not needed to locate a record which didnt resolve.
	

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added OnResolveError event to all database adapter cursorclasses.
        - Added SQLDirect database adapter.

        - Fixed adding kbmList to kbmMWBinaryStreamFormat.
        - Removed public property OK from resolvers.
        - Moved ErrorTable from resolver to TkbmMWCustomPooledCursor.

          of the resolvers. Now it automatically adds an error record in case of an exception in the events.
        - Fixed TCPIP Indy client side transport where ConnectTimeout which is given in secs was
          was not correctly recalculated to msecs.
        - Fixed ADOX resolver which was broken in 1.04.


 1.04  14. Aug 2003

        Important notes
        ===============
	* Added support for resolving multiple table joins.
	  To support joined multitable resolves, the binary stream format used for streaming
	  datasets unfortunately had to be changed in a non backward compatible way.
	  If you do not need to resolve multiple joined tables automatically or use the Origin property
	  of fields on the client side, you can retain backward compability by defining
	  KBMMWBINARYSTREAMFORMAT_PRE104 in kbmMWBinaryStreamFormat.pas
	* Moved updating stats to UpdateGlobalStats and UpdateServiceStats.
	  The change result in slightly different stats between service and global stats.
	  Global stats still contain transport time, service stats do not.

        New stuff
        =========

	- Added FillInsertObjectParams, FillModifyObjectParams and FillDeleteObjectParams
	  to TkbmMWCustomSQLParamsResolver which handles filling TParams with correct values.
	- Optimized filling of values during resolving which should give a significantly
	  performance improvement specially when resolving many altered/new/deleted records.
	- Now enforcing that parameter names must never contain 'illegal' characters.
	  If they do, they are automatically converted to valid names.
	- Added ListAttributesOptional:boolean to TkbmMWFileServiceDefinition.
	  Default false. If set to true, the files do not have to match the list attributes
	  exactly to be included in a file list.
	- Added OnAccessFile and OnReleaseFile events to TkbmMWFilePool.
	  Via the OnAccessFile its possible to f.ex. compress a file first for get
	  and return a new temp filename for the compressed file.
	  The OnReleaseFile is called when all references to a file has been released,
	  and a cleanup can be made.
	- Added support for returning attributes as Result[4] in PerformSTATUS in TkbmMWFileService.
	- Added StatFile(ARemotePath:string):TkbmMWFileStatus and StatFileEx to TkbmMWFileClient.
	- Added public read only property InternalClient to TkbmMWCustomClientCursor and
	  TkbmMWClientTransactionResolver. Returns the internal client instance.
	- Added public InternalClient property in client datasets to get access to the internally used client.
	- Added support for resolving multiple table joins.
	  To support joined multitable resolves, the binary stream format used for streaming
	  datasets unfortunately had to be changed in a non backward compatible way.
	  If you do not need to resolve multiple joined tables automatically or use the Origin property
	  of fields on the client side, you can retain backward compability by defining
	  KBMMWBINARYSTREAMFORMAT_PRE104 in kbmMWBinaryStreamFormat.pas
	- Added support for SchemaName and PackageName for stored procedures, and SchemaName for queries.
	  The changes are both in base classes and on the DBX and X adapter.
	- Added NexusDB v1 database adapter.

        Fixes/changes
        =============
	- Changed TkbmMWServer.ProcessRequest from virtual abstract to virtual.
	  Default it now raises an exception with function not known.
	- Fixed TkbmMWCustomTransportStream.ReadVariant not correctly reading
	  null and empty values.
	- Reordered properties on all database adapters to make sure Params and ParamCheck
	  comes _after_ any StoredProcName or SQL property to load in correct order.
	- Fixed setting CookedStoredProc in the setting of the stored proc name in
	  TkbmMWCustomDataset.
	- Improved checking for empty streams in ZIP decompression.
	- Split TkbmMWServer.ServeRequest into InternalServeStream, ServeStream and ServeRequest.
	- Moved updating stats to UpdateGlobalStats and UpdateServiceStats.
	  The change result in slightly different stats between service and global stats.
	  Global stats still contain transport time, service stats do not.
	- Fixed version on Zipped and HTTP transport stream formats to allow for
	  extended standard stream attributes.
	- Fixed bug returning nil instead of InternalClient in client property
	  of TkbmMWCustomClientDataset and TkbmMWClietnTransactionResolve after setting
	  the client property to nil.
	- Fixed A/V when deleting a client connected used by a client dataset.
	- Fixed HTTP streamformat that would result in never getting a response back from a request.
	- Fixed A/V in PerformDefinitions in DBX adapter.
	- Updated DB Adapter wizard to match new resolver layout.
	- Fixed bug in SQL generation which would result in an extra invalid delimiter
	  in update or insert statements if prior field was partly excluded from either update
	  or insert in OnExcludeFromUpdateInsert event.
	- Fixed Indy 8 compability problem in Indy transport.
	- Fixed D5 compability problem.
        - Fixed not checking for parameters when ParamCheck:=false even during designtime.

 1.03  12. July 2003

        Important notes
        ===============
        * Altered Java service to require the import of kbmmw.* (kbmmw.kbmMWRequest and
          kbmmw.kbmMWClientIdentity) classes. Now client identity is provided for the
          Java service call. Eg. 
               Object ProcessRequest(String Func,
                                     kbmmw.kbmMWClientIdentity Ident,
                                     Object [] Args)
        * Added support for Java requesting a service on the kbmMW server.
          kbmmw.kbmMWRequest.kbmMWRequest(String ServiceName,
                                          String ServiceVersion,
                                          String AFunction,
                                          kbmmw.kbmMWClientIdentity Ident,
                                          Object [] Args)
          Several variants of the kbmMWRequest functions exist for easy access with
          simple arguments.

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added BeforeResolve and AfterResolve events to all resolvable datasets.
        - Added kbmMWCreateCallbackFunction and kbmMWDisposeCallbackFunction in kbmMWGlobal.pas.
          These methods allow for making callback to a method in a class.
        - Altered Java service to require the import of kbmmw.* (kbmmw.kbmMWRequest and
          kbmmw.kbmMWClientIdentity) classes. Now client identity is provided for the
          Java service call. Eg. 
               Object ProcessRequest(String Func,
                                     kbmmw.kbmMWClientIdentity Ident,
                                     Object [] Args)
        - Added support for Java requesting a service on the kbmMW server.
          kbmmw.kbmMWRequest.kbmMWRequest(String ServiceName,
                                          String ServiceVersion,
                                          String AFunction,
                                          kbmmw.kbmMWClientIdentity Ident,
                                          Object [] Args)
          Several variants of the kbmMWRequest functions exist for easy access with
          simple arguments.

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Fixed bug in kbmMWStats.pas loading Min value instead of Max.
        - Fixed bug in kbmMWVariantToStream saving one byte to little.
        - Changed so AfterPost/AfterDelete event always happens _after_ any potential
          resolve due to ResolveOnChanged being true.
        - Updated dbadapter wizard.
        - Updated to respect Enabled property of the service definition.
          If service is disabled, no new requests to that service will be allowed.
        - Moved all array of variant handling to kbmMWGlobal.pas from kbmMWFileClient.pas.
        - Added support for controlling gathering of service statistics from the service
          definition. Now both the servicedefinition.GatherStatistics and the service
          property GatherStatistics must be true for service statistics to be gathered. 
          GatherStatistics on the servicedefinition is default true.
          GatherStatistics on the service is default false.
        - Changed MaxConnections property to allow for -1 value for not limiting
          the number of connections (generally not recommended since it could be exploited
          by malicious clients to cause a 'meltdown' of the database by spamming it with
          requests opening new connections all the time. 0 means that no connections
          are available in the connectionpool, and all attempts to get them will fail.
        - Fixed so Shutdown respect calling DestroyLastService method right before last
          service is destroyed.

 1.02  7. July 2003

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added ZEOS6 support. Define KBMMW_ZEOS6_SUPPORT in kbmMWConfig.inc to enable it.
        - Added OLEDBCompatible boolean property to TkbmMWDBXConnectionPool (WIndows only).
          Set it to TRUE if you are using any OLEDB drivers, like MSSQL etc.
        - Added public OK function to all resolvers. Return true if last resolving was
          successful (no records in ErrorTable).
        - Added protected virtual functions GetRequireTableName and GetRequireKeyFieldNames
          which both return boolean. Default returnvalue is true.
        - Updated TkbmMWCustomResolver to throw an exception if TableName not set and
          GetRequireTableName is true, or if KeyFieldNames is not set and GetRequireKeyFieldNames
          is true instead of failing silently. 
        - Added public RequestAttributes and ResponseAttributes TStrings properties to TkbmMWCustomClient
          and published them on TkbmMWSimpleClient. They allow for sending and receiving additional
          information via the kbmMW request/response header without affecting the service call.
        - Added OnSend and OnReceive events to all transports.

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Fixed compilation problem of BDE adapter in Delphi5.
        - Fixed D7 runtime project which accidentally included requirement of ReportBuilder.
        - Fixed DADO compilation problem.
        - Improved TkbmMWBinaryStreamFormat to be able to skip data for fields which
          are not existing in the receiving table. This is not 100% foolproof if the
          field to be skipped is a memo or blob. There is no way to make it foolproof
          without breaking backwards stream compability.
        - Modifed wizard registration to work better with CLX setups.
        - Fixed Indy8 compile problems with .Connect method.
        - Fixed calling OnServeResponse even when exceptions happen on the server.
        

 1.01  3. July 2003

        New stuff
        =========
        - Published AutoAddIndexes on TkbmMWClientxxxx dataset components.
        - Added GetMetaData support on adapters and clientquery.
        - Added OnAuthenticateMetaData to TkbmMWQueryService and descendants.
          Return Permissions:=[mwapExecute] to allow a client to get metadata information.
        - Updated ADOX, ADS6, BDE, DAO, DBISAM3, DBX, DOA, IBO and IBX5 database adapters
          to support GetMetaData. Its not required for a database adapter to support it,
          but ReportBuilder will not be able to use a database for which the adapter do
          not support it.
        - Added ReportBuilder DADE support.
        - Added TdakbmMWDatabase component of which at least one must be placed on the
          client form on which ReportBuilder designing happens (end use report design).
          Its searched and used by the RB DADE to determine which databases are available.
          A database is a combination of the name of the TdakbmMWDatabase component and
          the names of the published queries on the given query service.
          This way its possible to have access to multiple, different databases from the
          RB client at the same time.
        - Updated database wizard to support GetMetaData.
 
        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Fixed compilation problem when installing in Indy v. 8.0.23.
        - Fixed compilation problem in ADO Express adapter.
        - Fixed compilation problem in DOA adapter.

 1.00  1. July 2003

        Important notes
        ===============
        * V. 1.00 require kbmMemTable v. 3.12.  

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added copying StateID when ClientAsTemplate:=true.
        - Added ConnectTimeout property to custom client transport. Added support for it in the
          Indy client transport. Default value is 60 (one minute).
        - Added support for kbmX database adapter. Its a cross database adapter where the database
          type can be changes by simply pointing the connectionpool property to another connectionpool.
        - Added EnableMacros and Macros properties on all real database adapters allowing to
          use macros in the form {%MACRONAME%} inside query statements. Set Macros to contain
          eg. MACRONAME=somevalue.
        - Updated database adapter wizard to handle new cross database setups.
        - Updated database adapters with new class functions, GetQueryClass, GetStoredProcClass and GetResolverClass
          for cross adapter compatibility.
        - Published AutoAddIndexes on all adapter datasets.
        - Added AssignTo and AssignEventsTo to TkbmMWCustomResolver and descendents.
        - Added public readonly ConnectionPool property to TkbmMWCustomConnection.
        - Virtualized EnsureMinConnections, GetBestConnection, TimeoutConnections,
          KillConnections, TimeOutConnection, KillConnection, IncCacheHits, IncCacheMisses.
        - Prepared code for Freeware edition.

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Fixed wrong order of decompressing/decrypting on both server and client.
        - Fixed C6 installation problem.

 1.00rc3c 15. June 2003

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Fixed important bug in TkbmMWFileClient where Getting a file would accidentally call
          a delete of a file on the server side due to naming conflict of SysUtils.DeleteFile
          and TkbmMWFileClient.DeleteFile.
        - Fixed important server problem with service version which were case sensitive.
          Now case insensitive.

 1.00rc3b 13. June 2003

        Important notes
        ===============
        * Added TkbmMWFileServiceDefinition to TkbmMWFileService. Removed several published properties
          from TkbmMWFileService module to include them in the file service definition instead.
          This require opening all file service modules and ignoring any property errors, then recompile.
          Also remember to set the correct settings on the servicedefinition returned by RegisterService.

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added kbmMWDebugTypes global variable which can be set to a set of debug types that
          should be included in the debug output. Currently mwdtTransport,mwdtService,mwdtServer
          and mwdtDataset are defined.
        - Added support for KBMMW_NODEBUG compile flag which (if defined) will ensure that only empty
          debug functions are compiled in.
        - Added debug for generated SQL in SQL params resolver.

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Fixed caching problem which resulted in empty recordset from cached item.
        - Fixed retaining current record after resolve.
        - Added TkbmMWFileServiceDefinition to TkbmMWFileService. Removed several published properties
          from TkbmMWFileService module to include them in the file service definition instead.
        - Modified JNI.pas to support Delphi 5. Removed need for JNI_MD.pas.
          Delphi 5 do not currently support TDateTime variants to Java conversion.


 1.00rc3 7. June 2003

        Important notes
        ===============
        * Added InsertKeyFields property to resolvers. This is default false. It controls if
          new records are allowed to provide values for the key fields. Notice that since UpdateKeyFields
          until now also was in control of insert situations, this will possibly require changes in property
          settings for all application servers.
        * Removed publising unused properties like DateLayout, TimeLayout, DateTimeLayout, TrueValue and FalseValue
          from all SQL params type resolvers. The properties may only be interesting with non params resolvers.
          Notice this change _require_ you to open _all_ datamodules containing resolver components,
          and ignore all property errors, save and recompile.
        * Modified OnExcludeFromUpdateInsert event to return a set of field provider flags instead of a boolean.
        * Split TkbmMWServiceDefinition into TkbmMWCustomServiceDefinition and TkbmMWServiceDefinition.
          RegisterService now returns a TkbmMWCustomServiceDefinition instead of a TkbmMWServiceDefinition.

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added kbmMWDebugLevel and kbmMWDebugWhere global variables which controls how debug are made.
          If to a file, a temporary file is generated in the default temp directory.
        - Added kbmMWDebugDumpTransportStream global method.
        - Added ReceivedCount virtual function to TkbmMWCustomTransport. Should be overridden to
          return the number of bytes waiting to be handled in the transport. Returns default -1
          which means that there are no knowledge about the number of waiting bytes.
          Updated TCPIP Indy transport to support ReceivedCount.
          Updated TCPIP Indy Client transport to allow for RequestTimeout (in secs), -1 is indefinitely.
          Added ReceivedCount to transport plugins too.
        - Added InsertKeyFields property to resolvers. This is default false. It controls if
          new records are allowed to provide values for the key fields. Notice that since UpdateKeyFields
          until now also was in control of insert situations, this will possibly require changes in property
          settings for all application servers.
          Updated all relevant resolvers to publish InsertKeyFields.
          Updated db adapterwizard to support it.
        - Added ConstructFirstService and DestroyLastService protected service methods which can be overriden.
          They are called on creation of first service instance in service pool, and destruction of last service
          instance in service pool.
        - Added protected BeforeRequest and AfterRequest methods to TkbmMWCustomService.
          They can be overridden, but remember to call inhertied.
        - Added TkbmMWCustomJavaService which makes integration with Java very easy. Requires LEVEL6+ compiler.
          Thus it will not compile under Delphi 5. The Java support uses Jedi's JNI support code modified slightly
          to enable dynamical loading of the Java library. The modified JNI.pas unit is included in the
          kbmMW distribution.
        - Added Attribs:TStringList property to TkbmMWCustomServiceDefinition.
        - Added additional field provider flag, mwpfInInsert.
        - Rewrote HTTP streamformat to interact correctly with proxy servers.
          Using HTTP streamformat now also automatically disconnects client after receiving each response.
        - Split TkbmMWServiceDefinition into TkbmMWCustomServiceDefinition and TkbmMWServiceDefinition.

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Modified OnExcludeFromUpdateInsert event to return a set of field provider flags instead of a boolean.
        - Removed publising unused properties like DateLayout, TimeLayout, DateTimeLayout, TrueValue and FalseValue
          from all SQL params type resolvers. The properties may only be interesting with non params resolvers.
          Notice this change _require_ you to open _all_ datamodules containing resolver components,
          and ignore all property errors, save and recompile.
        - Updated db adapter wizard to only publish those properties on non params SQL resolver components.
        - Updated TkbmMWEventService with two new events, OnConstructFirstService and OnDestroyLastService.
        - Fixed Kylix compilation.
        - Fixed trying to reconnect if client fails receiving data on a request.
        - Improved transport stream handling of null and empty variants.

 1.00rc2e 17. May 2003
        Important notes
        ===============
        * Altered OnReconnect's Sender to be a client transport instead of a client component.

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added OnConnected and OnDisconnected events to server and client transports.
        - Added OnConnectionLost event to client transports. Its called when all reconnection attempts has failed.
        - Added InStream and OutStream arguments to TkbmMWServer.Request function.
          If the streams are of TMemoryStream type, the streams are used directly. If not, the stream
          contents are copied as needed.

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Fixed Div by zero bug in fileservice when file transferred is of zero size.
        - Fixed A/V when setting BoundTransport:=nil.
        - Altered reconnection algorithm for clients to allow for MaxRetries=0 and MaxRetriesAlternative>0
          to allow connecting to alternative host immediately after connection failed.  
        - Altered OnReconnect's Sender to be a client transport instead of a client component.


 1.00 RC2d 10. May 2003

        Fixes/changes
        =============
	Includes missing ressource file.

 1.00 RC2c 10. May 2003

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        Changed the AQuery parameter of OnGetNamedQuery on the query service to be of var type.
        Added a Request function to TkbmMWServer which makes calling a service much easier on server side.
        Fixed some A/V's possible when a service was not obtained.
        Fixed a few other minor things.
        Fixed DADO adapter which wouldnt compile due to a renamed object in CreateModifyObject.

 1.00 RC2b

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        Fixed ZIPPPED transport which was not updated correctly.

 1.00 RC2 29. Apr 2003

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added OnResolveInitialization and OnResolveFinalization events to all resolvers.
        - Updated database adapter wizard accordingly.
        - Added OnGarbageCollectQuery event to TkbmMWServer which will be called for each
          service instance being evaluated for garbagecollection.
          This way garbage collection of a specific service can be forced or canceled at developers
          will.
        - Added Timeout property to service definition. Set > 0 (secs) to define a timeout for how
          long time a request may run in a service before the service instance gets terminated.
        - Added support for STATUS request in file service. Accepts one argument (filepath) and returns
          variant array (Size,creationtime,accesstime,modificationtime) or null if no file found.
        - Added support for sub format control of the standard transport format.
          Set an Params on transport to 'KBMMW_STANDARDTRANSPORTSTREAN_FORMAT' (const mwstsfAttrName)
          to 'RAW' or 'STANDARD' (default). Setting to RAW means floats and datetimes
          are transported in a raw binary format which may not be portable while all other variant types
          are transported as text.
          Setting to STANDARD or not setting it at all means that the standard transport format
          is used which transports floats, datetimes and all other variant types as text.
        - Added DoInitializeState/InitializeState and DoFinalizeState/FinalizeState methods
          which are called when a stateful service needs to be initialized for a client (default values set)
          and finalized when the state is released.
        - Updated service wizard to support the new methods.
        - Added support for FastZLib in ZIPPED transport stream format.
          Define KBMMW_ZIPPED_USE_FASTZLIB in kbmMWConfig.inc file to enable.
          Notice that the compression is not compatible with ZLib. Thus servers and clients
          must all use same library.
        - Added support for transport parameter KBMMW_ZIPPEDTRANSPORTSTREAM_COMPRESSION
          which should be set to a value (-1=default, 0=no compression, 1=fastests, 2=default,
          3=max. (These values are not used by the standard ZLib library).
        - Added several new events to TkbmMWEventService:
            OnConstructService, OnDestroyService, OnInitializeService, OnFinalizeService,
            OnInitializeState, OnFinalizeState

        Fixes/changes
        =============

        - Fixed bug in kbmMW ADS6 db adapter.
        - Changed OnGetNamedQuery from function to procedure to be compatible with C++Builder.
        - Updated IBO database adapter to include support for IBO_Session which should solve
          threading problems.
        - Took care of platform warnings and hints.
        - Fixed DOA db adapter compile bugs and problems due to inconsistency between DOA Delphi and BCB version.
        - Published Params property on TkbmMWTCPIPIndyServerTransport, TkbmMWTCPIPDXSockServerTransport,
          TkbmMWISAPIServerTransport and TkbmMWISAPIClientTransport.
        - Fixed not returning StateID from newly started stateful service.



 1.00 RC1 18. Apr 2003

        New stuff
        =========

        - Added ID property to servicedefinition. Its used to assign a unique (for that
          specific pool) number to a service.
        - Added WriteFloat, WriteDateTime, WriteObject and ReadFloat, ReadDateTime and ReadObject to
          transport stream format. Allows for moving special objects and improved streaming customization for
          floating point and date time values.
        - Added IkbmMWObject interface which can be used to prepare a class of your own for
          automatic streaming via kbmMW.
        - Added TkbmMWObject class which can be used as base for custom streamable classes.
        - Added following functions for supporting new custom variant type for dealing with objects.
          (New variable variant type only for D6+)
            function kbmMWVarObjectCreate(AObject:TObject):Variant;
            function kbmMWVarObjectCreateAutoDispose(AObject:TObject):Variant;
            function kbmMWVarObject:TVarType;
            function kbmMWObjectFromVar(AVariant:variant):TObject;
        - Altered registration of custom objects.
        - Added/altered the following functions for registration purposes:
            procedure kbmMWRegisterStreamableObject(AObjectClass:TClass; AObjectReader:TkbmMWObjectReader; AObjectWriter:TkbmMWObjectWriter); overload;
            procedure kbmMWRegisterStreamableObject(AObjectClass:TClass); overload;
            function kbmMWGetStreamableObjectClass(AObjectClassName:string):TClass;

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Fixed A/V if Database template not set on DB adapter. Now will throw an exception instead
          if trying to open a connection. 
        - Fixed to raise an exception after rollback if resolving goes wrong in TkbmMWTransactionResolver. 
        - Fixed bug in ADO Express adapter when fetching field origins.
        - Changed so Sender of OnAuthenticate event on TkbmMWServer is the requested service.
        - Fixed bug which could lead to IDE hanging on project close.
        - Fixed not checkpointing on all or nothing client resolving.



 1.00 Beta 3.5 2. Apr 2003
        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Fixed kbmMWWaitSemaphore which used ATimeout instead of t for Windows.
        - Fixed several hints about declared variables not being used in kbmMWClientDataset.pas.
        - Fixed IBX adapter to be able to compile under Delphi5.
        - Fixed Connection string editor uses clause to better cope with Kylix and Delphi5 at the same time.
        - Fixed Indy 8 compatibility issue in kbmMWTCPIPIndyTransport.pas.
        - Fixed FileVersion declared twice problem in kbmMWStreamFormat and kbmMWBinaryStreamFormat.
        - Added kbmMWStripQuotes function to kbmMWGlobal.pas. It takes a string and returns a string removing
          all " and ' from it.
        - Modified so all field origins are delivered without quotes.
        - Fixed BDE adapter to keep connection even when last query closed.
        - Fixed bug in client receiving errortable after resolve.

 1.00 Beta 3.4 1. Apr 2003
        New stuff
        =========
        - Added TkbmMWClientTransactionResolver component.
        - Made several changes in transaction handling in the customqueryservice and queryservice
          to allow for client side multidataset resolving under transactional control.
	- Added OnGetNamedQuery event on TkbmMWQueryService and descendants.
        - Added support for OnGetNamedQuery event on all relevant places in the query service.
        - Added Active boolean property to TkbmMWCustomConnectionPool (and all descendants).
          If set false, connections cannot be obtained through the connection pool, and garbage
          collection is suspended. Thus remember to set to true (default) before opening any queries.
        - Added AdsCharType property to TkbmMWADS6Query and TkbmMWADS6StoredProc.
        - Published property SkipFieldsWithoutOrigin on all relevant resolvers. It controls if
          a field without any origin setting should be resolved or not. Default false.
          Updated db wizard to support it.
        - Added IgnoreRowsAffected property to DBExpress adapter. Default false.
          If set to true, the resolver will not test how many rows was affected during the
          update/insert/delete operation. This is due to DBX not fully supporting a
          correct RowsAffected value for several databases.

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Fixed TkbmMWSessionPool.Shutdown which were missing a conversion to secs.
        - Fixed TCPIP Indy server transport to gracefully be able to bind to specific IP
          on a multiple IP server.
        - Fixed bug in file service and file client on transferring files which sizes matching a full
          multiplum of a blocksize.
        - Fixed A/V if requesting named query which do not exist.
        - Fixed client briefcase not storing deleted records. That would result in the records not
          being deleted on the backend db on a resolve.
        - Fixed idlecheck to make garbage collection of long running services work correctly.
        - Fixed handling of datetime and float values conversion for streaming in custom transport.
          Now will use new FormatSettings public property on custom transport (Delphi7+ only)
          or use the local locale settings for the client. Pre Delphi7 the local settings
          can be changed using the global format variables in Delphi/BCB (notice that this change
          the format globally for the complete application, thus the D7 FormatSettings is the better
          way to do it.
        - Fixed A/V when query/st.proc tries to obtain connection but cant.
        - Changed EnableVersioning on all TkbmMWCustomPooledDataset descendants to True.
        - Fixed compile bugs under Kylix3 for Delphi.
        - Fixed ADOExpress adapter to correctly handle calculated fields like Count(xx) etc.

 1.00 Beta 3.3 11. Mar 2003
        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Fixed designtime dialogs not working in D5.
        - Changed so loadbalancer not running probe during designtime.
        - Added OnProbeConnectFailed event to the loadbalancers. Its called
          when its not able to connect to a server.
        - Fixed invalid reference to FDeleteQuery in autogenerated adapters via the DB adapter wizard.
        - Fixed a few misspellings in helper texts here and there.
        - Fixed LoadBalancer property when loadbalancer being deleted.
        - Fixed Transport property on loadbalancer when transport being deleted.
        - Fixed fetching parameters for SP's/Queries having persisitent fields.
        - Changed PerformRefreshDefinitions to include a boolean parameter controling
          if definition update only is for parameters or also includes fields.
        - Altered DB adapter wizard to take PerformRefreshDefinitions change into account.
        - Altered way fielddefinitions are fetched in case persistent fields are already defined.
          Now allows for fetching parameters anyway.
        - Fixed not allowing blob fields to be part of the key in update and delete statements.
        - Altered DBISAM queries to be live instead of readonly of performance reasons.
        - Fixed loadbalancer transport exception when loading application where loadbalancer active. 


 1.00 Beta 3 24. Feb 2003
        Important notes
        ===============
        * The dataset streaming format has changed.
          Thus all clients and servers using dataset streaming must be recompiled.
        * GetStateful method in services now removed in favor for flag in GetFlags.
        * Reversed order of encryption and compression in the server and client to
          improve performance. This change require clients and servers to be recompiled
          with latest release if they are using both encryption and compression.

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added TkbmMWCustomPooledSimpleClient and TkbmMWPooledSimpleClient.
          They supports using a transport connection pool instead of a transport directly.
        - Added ClientAsTemplate boolean property to control if ClientQuery/ClientStoredProc
          property Client should be used as is or as a template (default).
        - Added ListenerThreadPriority, SpawnedThreadPriority, UseThreadPool
          ThreadCacheSize to DXSocks transport. Use according to DXSocks docs.
        - Added ConnectionString property to client transports.
        - Added virtual EncodeConnectionString and DecodeConnectionString methods which
          are called to encode and decode the connectionstring for the specific transport.
        - Added support for persistent services. A persistent service will never time out
          or be owned by any client like a stateful service. Thus the service can contain
          a global state, but not a client specific state.
        - Added PrivateDir and NetFileDir properties to TkbmMWBDEConnectionPool.
        - Added backward compability support for 0.93a-c on the binary streamformat.
          The server will automatically answer with the version of the streamformat
          used by the client.
          Current binary (default) stream format is 101.
        - Added new services: TkbmMWSimpleService and TkbmMWEventService.
          Simple service is the same as TkbmMWCustomService but publish a few events
          like OnBeforeRequest, OnAfterRequest and OnAuthenticate.
          Event service is the same as TkbmMWSimpleService except it publish a new
          event OnRequest which can be used to write the business code instead
          of overriding ProcessRequest.
          Changed bundled services to descent from TkbmMWSimpleService instead
          of TkbmMWCustomService.
        - AutoCreateDirectories property added to TkbmMWFilePool. If set to true,
          directories will automatically be created when files are uploaded to the
          server.
        - Added OnServeResponse event to kbmMW which is called right before the response
          is served back to the client.
        - Added support for Origin property on fields. Require kbmMemTable v. 3.08 or newer.
        - Added new functions CreateInsertObject, CreateModifyObject, CreateDeleteObject
          and FreeResolverObject to resolvers. Added AObject;TObject argument to
          DoInsertRecord, DoModifyRecord, DoDeleteRecord resolver functions.
        - Updated all datastore adapters to use the new object style resolvers.
        - Added optional PerformFieldOrigins method to TkbmMWCustomPooledDataset
          which may be overriden by database adapters to set correct origin of
          field in form Tablename.Fieldname based on an actual query.
          1) Verified that the following adapters do not require change to give correct origin:
             IBX (IB Express), DBISAM3
          2) Updated the following adapters to support returning the correct origin:
             ADOX (ADO Express)
          3) The following datastores/API's do not allow for any reliable way to get
          correct origins automatically which means that the origin info must be
          set manually in multitable resolving:
             BDE, DBX (DB Express)
          4) The following adapters do not support multitable updates at all, unless
          a customized resolver is created and used:
             MT (kbmMemTable), FF2 (FlashFiler 2)
          Other adapters not listed here has not been verified at this time with regards
          to correctness of origin handling and may fall into any of the 4 categories.
          The purpose of all the datastore adapter changes is to allow for complex
          transaction handling and automated multitable resolving in for example
          join situations etc.
        - Added support for pfInUpdate and pfInKey field provider flags on both server
          and client side.
        - Added kbmMWSetAffinityMas and kbmMWGetAffinityMask to kbmMWGlobal.pas.
        - Added experimental support for Kylix 3 for Delphi.
        - Added new TkbmMWCustomTransportPlugin class which can be subclassed to create
          advanced plugins that can be connected to the transport.
        - Added Plugin property to all transports.
        - Added DoConnected and DoDisconnected to TkbmMWCustomTransport which
          should be called whenever a client connect or disconnect.
        - Added Certificate and Attributes to TkbmMWCustomTransportInfo.
        - Added TkbmMWClientTransportInfo.
        - Added StreamSecII transport plugin for SSL/TLS support. Require
          StreamSecII v. 1.6.87 or newer. Uncomment KBMMW_TRANSPORTPLUGIN_SS2_TLS
          in the configuration file to include its support.
        - Added StreamSecII crypt component. Uncomment KBMMW_CRYPT_SS2 in the configuration
          file to include its support.
        - Added support for DiamondAccess. Uncomment KBMMW_DOA_SUPPORT in the configuration
          file to include its support.
        - Added CreationTime:TDateTime, StartServingTIme:TDateTime, StopServingTIme:TDateTime,
          LastRequestTime:TDateTime, AccRequestTime:TDateTime and AccRequestCount:longint
          to TkbmMWServer. The properties gives timing and count information.
        - Added UniqueIdentifier to TkbmMWServer which contains a server generated
          string which should be worldwide unique.
        - Added BoundTransport to TkbmMWCustomService. Optionally set it to
          the server transport component which this service is only allowed to
          be run via.
        - Added MinCount to TkbmMWServiceDefinition which defines how many instances
          as minimum there must be running of a service at any time. MinCount should
          be less or equal to MaxCount. Setting MinCount>MaxCount automatically
          bumps up MaxCount. -1 means no MinCount set.
        - Added class function GetMinInstances:integer to TkbmMWCustomService.
          Override this in a service to let the service define how many instances
          should always run of it.
        - Added class function GetMaxInstances:integer to TkbmMWCustomService.
          Override this in a service to let the service define the max number of
          instances to run.
        - Added Loadbalancing service (TkbmMWCustomLoadBalancing) and loadbalancer
          components (TkbmMWRoundRobinLoadBalancer, TkbmMWRandomLoadBalancer,
          TkbmMWBestFitLoadBalancer) based on TkbmMWCustomLoadBalancer.
          The loadbalancing service is used by other servers to obtain availability
          and performance information from the server. The information is used
          to deterimine which server to loadbalance to.
          Updated TkbmMWCustomClient components to handle loadbalancing replys
          from servers.

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Fixed db adapter wizard code generation.
        - Fixed bug in query ExecSQL/Execute on client which resulted in variant exception.
        - Fixed serious bug in connection pooling mechanism which resulted in allocation
          of too many connections despite maxconnections set in some situations.
        - Fixed bug in ADOExpress adapter which resulted in lost db connections.
        - Fixed garbagecollection timeout comparison on service garbagecollection.
        - Fixed so FinalizeService is guaranteed to be called when current request has
          finished using the service.
        - Added a little more exception handling in DXSocks transport to guarantee
          release of some temporary allocated memory.
        - Altered the way the HTTP header is removed in ISAPI transport.
        - Moved Stateful from being a seperate function (GetStateful) to being
          a serviceflag (mwsfStateful) in GetFlags. Updated wizard accordingly.
        - Changed use of affinitymask in kbmMWServer.pas to use newly added functions.
          Will make a kbmMW based server run on Win95 provided WinSock2 is installed.
        - Made several small changes and fixes here and there to allow for Kylix 3 support.
        - Fixed bug setting Inventory value which would A/V the IDE.
        - Rearranged TkbmMWCustomTransportInfo and TkbmMWServerTransportInfo
          to make it the responsibility of the transport to create an instance
          when a client connects and destroy it when the client disconnects.
        - Fixed a few bugs in transport handling.
        - Reversed order of encryption and compression in the server and client to
          improve performance. This change require clients and servers to be recompiled
          with latest release if they are using both encryption and compression.
        - Fixed client datasets FetchDefinitions to fetch definitions regardless of
          AutoFieldDefsOnOpen.
        - Fixed Params property (missing setter method) on TkbmMWCustomTransport.
        - Published properties DetailFields, MasterSource and MasterFields on database
          adapters. Updated wizard to include them on new adapters.


 1.00 Beta 2 10. Nov 2002
        Important notes
        ===============
        * The transport format has changed.
          Thus all clients and servers must be recompiled.
        * RegisterService calls have changed.
          Instead of the many arguments to them, set the properties
          of the returned TkbmMWServiceDefinition object.

        New stuff
        =========
        - Added testing for Windows ME in kbmMWGetOSVersion.
        - Added CacheFlags to all database adapters and client datasets.
          Setting mwcfDontAge to true doesnt remove a cached entry even if its too old.
          it will however be removed if the number of cached entries are bigger than the
          MaxCacheEntries allowed. This can be prevented by setting mwcfDontGarbageCollect.
        - Published AutoFieldDefsOnOpen on all database adapters.
        - Added support for defining stateful services. This breaks transport compability
          with v. 1.00beta1 app servers or clients.
        - Added GetStateful method to service. Return true if a service should
          be stateful. Default false.
        - Added StateID property to client which is -1 if client doesnt hold a stateid from server.
        - Changed RegisterService and RegisterServiceByName to functions returning a TkbmMWServiceDefinition.
          Removed several arguments from Register.... Instead set options on the returned service definition.
        - Added MaxIdleStatefulTime property to TkbmMWServiceDefinition. Stateful services are
          garbage collected according to this value instead of the MaxIdleTime value.
        - Added property StateIDs to TkbmMWCustomClient which contains information
          about all stateful services the client has running on the server.
        - Added ReleaseAllStates, ReleaseState and ReleaseStateID methods to TkbmMWCustomClient
          to gracefully release all, current or specific state on server.
        - Added ClearAllStates to clear states info on client without gracefully releasing
          them on the server.
        - Added support for special function named '__RELEASESTATE' in all services.
          Its purpose is to allow a client to release the state of a stateful service
          owned by the client.
        - Added support for transport stream format attributes which can be used to
          extend the header with additional information.
          The new state support and the attribute support require all clients and servers to
          be recompiled.
        - Added OnConnect and OnDisconnect events to TCPIP Indy server transport.
        - Added support for DXSocks 3.0 as transport.
          Define KBMMW_DXSOCKTCPIPTRANSPORT_SUPPORT in kbmMWConfig.inc.
        - Added support for using DXSocks 3.0 as ISAPI transport.
          Define KBMMW_ISAPITRANSPORT_USING_DXSOCK in kbmMWConfig.inc.
          If not defined uses Indy as always.

        Fixes/changes
        =============
        - Published Client property of TkbmMWClientQuery and TkbmMWClientStoredProc
        - Fixed spelling of Generel tab to General.
        - Fixed wrong count and missing raise in TkbmMWCustomDataset.Resolve.
        - Fixed not calling GetProcessAffinityMask and SetProcessAffinityMask on
          Win95,Win98,WinME.
        - Fixed missing Connected:=true and Connected:=false in InternalOpenConnection
          and InternalCloseConnection in the ADOX adapter.
        - Fixed file service file exclusive locking for files opened for read.
        - Fixed minor bug where Stat garbagecollection could give A/V during shutdown of server.
        - Fixed bug giving exception about databasename multiple defined in MYSQLDAC adapter.
        - Changed so exceptions even during fielddefinitions are propogated to client.
          This results in client not displaying 'There must be at least one field', but
          instead displays the reason for it.
        - Fixed transaction handling in IBX datastore adapter.
        - Fixed bug where exception during resolving would not be propogated back to client.


 1.00 Beta 1 31. Oct 2002
        Important notes
        ===============
        * This release require kbmMemTable v. 3.06 or newer.
        * RegisterService and RegisterServiceByName now has additional parameters which must given.
          false,false are giving old behaviour.
        * The eventhandlers of the resolver has changed parameters and thus needs to be recreated.

        - Published AutoPopulateOnOpen:boolean on all database adapters and clientcursors.
          Controls if opening a dataset should perform requests to populate it with data.
        - Changed internal AutoFieldDefsOnOpen:boolean to AutoFieldDefsOnOpen:TkbmMWAutoFieldDefsOnOpen;
        - Published AutoFieldDefsOnOpen:TkbmMWAutoFieldDefsOnOpen on all database adapters and clientcursors.
          Controls when fielddefs should be updated when opening the dataset.
        - Moved connection features from TkbmMWCustomPooledCursor to parent TkbmMWCustomPooledDataset.
        - Added ObtainConnection and ReleaseConnection to TkbmMWCustomPooledDataset to
          simplify connection handling.
        - Added TkbmMWTransaction and TkbmMWTransactions for internal 2 phase commit transaction handling.
        - Added Default and DontQueue argument to RegisterService/RegisterServiceByName,
          Default can be set to false or true depending on if that specific service should be run in case no
          service match the clients request.
          DontQueue can be set to false (default) or true depending on if an error should be returned to the
          client in case no free service slots are available.
        - Added EnableDefaultService on TkbmMWServer which controls if a default service should be
          run in case no match for requested service is made.
        - Surfaced ServicePool:TkbmMWServicePool and TransportList:TkbmMWTransportList
          as public properties on TkbmMWServer.
        - Fixed a few minor bugs in the service wizard.
        - Added new standard service which should be extended: TkbmMWProxyService
          Its purpose is to work as a proxy between kbmMW clients and kbmMW app. servers.
          It should be used as default service, ie the one being called when no
          other service names matches.
        - Added MinClientPort and MaxClientPort to TkbmMWTCPIPIndyClientTransport when
          using Indy 9. Restricts the ports the client will use to communicate with the server.
        - Altered exception handling to allow returning Data and Token client identity parameters
          to client even if request was not ok.
        - Published OnGarbageCollection property on TkbmMWServer. It can be used to add some code which
          should be run regularly async of client requests.
        - Fixed bug when Query service always believed a request is a stored proc. when the service
          is being used for mixed purposes.
        - Made NamedQueryName and IsNamedQuery public properties of TkbMMWCustomQueryService writable.
        - Changed so all resolving will be using transactions if supported regardless of if AllOrNothing
          has been set. If AllOrNothing is false the transaction will be committed even when an exception
          was raised during resolve.
        - Removed invalid commit from IBO adapter.
        - Added property KillConnectionOnException:boolean which is default true to TkbmMWCustomPooledCursor.
        - Setting it to false forces kbmMW not to timeout a datastore connection even if last operation resulted
          in an exception.
        - Fixed case bug when locating a service in servicedefinitions. Wrong case could cause creating new service
          instances.
        - Fixed bugs in TkbmMWInventoryClient which would not accept and use version of neither
          inventory service or selected service.. Now issue Refresh each time to get updated
          inventory data.
        - Fixed IBO adapter to not include IBO generated DBKEY field.
        - Fixed MT adapter to check for template attachmaxcount on connection open
          if template is closed.
        - Fixed service wizard to include kbmMWGlobal and service and dbadapter wizards to include
          kbmMW.inc to get compiler level defines. Change from testing for VER140 to testing for LEVEL6.
        - Fixed not calling SetProcessAffinityMask on Win95/Win98 OS.
        - Fixed bug deleting crypt component while transport active.
        - Fixed bug not detecting missing TransportStreamFormat which resulted in AV.
        - Added FetchMaxRecords property to client datasets to limit the number of records fetched from server.
          This is different from FetchRecordsOnDemand as the later will in a later release fetch records on demand
          from server in blocks depending size of the value.
        - Added MinConnections to all connectionpools to allow preallocation of connections during runtime.
          Not active during designtime.
        - Added support for RowsAffected in all database adapters and the datastore adapter wizard.
        - Added support for RowsAffected in client dataset.
        - Published Client property of client datasets. It allows for pointing it to a TkbmMWCustomSimpleClient
          which will be used for communication towards the app. server. Notice that the transport property of that
          simple client is automatically set and reset by the client dataset connection pool.
          If Client is nil (not set) an internal generated simple client will be used (old behaviour).
          This change allows for one common setup place for client orientated settings like user, pwd etc.
        - Added datastore adapter for DOA (Direct Oracle Access from www.allroundautomations.com)
          Define KBMMW_DOA_SUPPORT in the kbmMWConfig.inc file to enable it.
          Requires kbmMemTable v. 3.06 or newer.
        - Added support for returning parameters from query execution.
        - Added datastore adapter for ODAC v. 4 (Oracle Direct Access Components from www.crlab.com)
          Define KBMMW_ODAC4_SUPPORT in the kbmMWConfig.inc file to enable it.
        - Added OnQueryStatement to TkbmMWCustomQuery which is called on each query/execute/definition/resolve
          request from clients. Its purpose is to allow the application server to rewrite the name of the named query
          or the statement before execution.
        - Fixed problem Token getting reset in client when server throws exception.
        - Added additional check for resolver inserts/updates/deletes are performed as expected.
        - Updated all database adapters to handle that check.
        - Updated datastore wizard to handle new check.

 0.93c  29. Aug. 2002
	Fixes/changes
	=============
        Fixed A/V when kbmMWServer removed before transport.
        Fixed Zeos MySQL adapter with resolve issues.
        Moved needed initialization and destruction code out of
        ConstructService and DestroyService to make it easier
        when subclassing TkbmMWCustomService.

 0.93b  28. Aug. 2002
	Fixes/changes
	=============
        - Fixed D6 project file which mistakenly included a non delivered file.
        - Fixed service stream problem where multiple copies or garbage would be included
          in the stream.
        - Fixed TIBDatabase bug in IBX5 database adapter.

 0.93a
        Important notes
	===============
        * This release require kbmMemTable v. 3.04 or newer.
        * Notice that due to changes in the streaming format between Delphi/BCB 5 and
          Delphi/BCB 6, TkbmMWBinaryStreamFormat had to be modified to support streaming those
          fields in a compatible way. This requires all clients and servers to be recompiled
          using this new format unless a define is uncommented. For more info, please
          check the header of the kbmMWBinaryStreamFormat.pas file.
        * Notice due to renaming of service functions within the CustomQueryService,
          pre v. 0.93a servers will not be compatible with clients running 0.93a or newer.
	* ExcludeFromUpdateInsert and ExcludeFromWhere events now as Sender as type
	  TkbmMWCustomQueryResolver.
	* Notice due to addition of extra Data value, the streamformat between client and server
	  have been changed which require a recompilation of all clients and servers.
	* Due to addition of garbage collection, an additional parameter has been added to all
	  RegisterService methods. To not have garbage collection set the parameter to 0.

	Fixes/changes
	=============
        - Fixed Stored procedure parameters not fetched problem.
        - Renamed PerformRefreshFieldDefs to PerformRefreshDefinitions throughout all sources
          to reflect the scope not only being field definitions but also possibly parameters.
        - Updated all database adapters supporting stored procedures to correctly reflect parameters.
        - Fixed problem not allowing for using Interbase Local driver with the BDE in kbmMW.
        - Improved IBX transaction support.
        - Fixed bug in resolvers in case of multiple key fields.
        - Fixed problem in CopyRawRecords which would affect caching of records not happening as
          it should.
        - Fixed problem with BCB (actually C++) not allowing virtual static's (class functions in Delphi).
          For a lengthy description see TkbmMWCustomService declaration.
        - Improved catching exceptions and propogating them to the client earlier on.
        - Made substantial inner changes in the TkbmMWClient component including the auto reconnect
          on error code.
        - Moved ExcludeFromUpdateInsert and ExcludeFromWhere events from TkbmMWCustomSQLResolver
          to TkbmMWCustomQueryResolver. This breaks existing eventhandler code since
          the Sender argument changed type to TkbmMWCustomQueryResolver.
        - Changed Token property to read/write on TkbmMWCustomClient.
        - Fixed returning the Token value to the client.
        - Updated transport formats from 100 to 101. This require
          all servers and clients being rebuild to operate.

	Additions
	=========
        - Added support for BCB 6 both for compilation/installation and in the service wizard.
          Currently a problem persists with the C++ autotranslation of the OnServeRequest.
          The call is not translated correctly by current versions of BCB. Thus in BCB servers
          please avoid using that event.
        - Added UniqueDBName property to TkbmMWBDEConnectionPool (default true) which controls
          if databasename should be made unique or not.
        - Added new TkbmMWClientStoredProc. Use as a normal TStoredProc after setting the default
          StoredProc to a TkbmMWxxxStoredProc on the queryservice, or use named stored procedures
          via the @NAME format (similar to the TkbmMWClientQuery operation).
        - Added support for default Stored procedure on query service.
        - Added FetchDefinitions to TkbmMWCustomClientCursor which therefore is available for
          TkbmMWClientQuery and TkbmMWClientStoredProc. It will fetch fielddefs and params from
          app server. This is required after setting f.ex. stored proc name and/or overload
          during runtime. During designtime, the definitions are fetched automatically.
        - Added support for using real instantiated objects as arguments and results for
          in client requests towards a service via the new functions in kbmMWGlobal.pas:
            function kbmMWObject2Variant(AObject:TObject):Variant;
            function kbmMWVariant2Object(AVariant:Variant):TObject;
            procedure kbmMWRegisterStreamableObject(AObjectClass:TClass;
                      AObjectReader:TkbmMWObjectReader; AObjectWriter:TkbmMWObjectWriter);
        - Added ZIPPED-HTTP transport stream format combining HTTP with compression.
          Add this definition to kbmMWConfig.inc to enable it:
             {$DEFINE KBMMW_ZIPPED_HTTP_TRANSPORTSTREAM_SUPPORT}
        - Added support for streaming calculated/lookup fields by setting the sfCalculated/sfLookup
          properties of TkbmMWBinaryStreamFormat.
        - Added ConstructService and DestroyService as alternative constructor/destructor methods
          in case something needs to be initialized/finalized for a service to work.
          The point of putting it here is to avoid needless initialization/finalization
          in cases where C++/BCB just needs to access some static info from the service
          like service flags/name/version etc.
        - Added InitializeService and FinalizeService virtual methods to a service.
          InitializeService is called after the service has been created and internal
          initialization is finished. FinalizeService is called right before the
          service ressources are freed and the serviceinstance is disposed.
        - Added new TkbmMWISAPIServerTransport and TkbmMWISAPIClientTransport. Put a
          ISAPI server transport on your datamodule and it will automatically be
          able to work as an ISAPI dll under any ISAPI compliant caching web server like
          IIS, WebServer etc. Put a ISAPI client transport on your clients and they
          can get to the application server via your standard web server. Thus
          no firewall problems :)
          Add the following definition in kbmMWConfig.inc to add support for it:
          {$DEFINE KBMMW_ISAPITRANSPORT_SUPPORT}                ISAPI support.
        - Made several changes to the inner workings of the transport and the transport stream.
          Added BeginReceive, ReceiveStream, ReceiveBuffer, ReceiveTransmissionHeader, EndReceive,
                BeginTransmit, TransmitStream, TransmitBuffer, TransmitTransmissionHeader, EndTransmit
          to TkbmMWCustomTransport.
          Removed DoEncrypt, DoDecrypt. Removed
          A transport _must_ provide at least ReceiveStream, ReceiveBuffer 
            and TransmitStream, TransmitBuffer.
          ReceiveTransmissionHeader and TransmitTransmissionHeader should (optionally) be used for
          sending verification data for the transported data, and routines to verify the transported data
          early on without having to receive all data. The earlier the transport can be 
          verified the better.
        - Added BeforeFetch, Fetch, AfterFetch,
                BeforeDeliver, Deliver, AfterDeliver,
                BeforeSigning, AfterSigning, BeforeVerify, AfterVerify,
                BeforeEncrypt, AfterEncrypt, BeforeDecrypt, AfterDecrypt,
                BeforeWriteHeader, AfterWriteHeader, BeforeReadHeader, AfterReadHeader
          to kbmMWCustomTransportStream.
          Removed Get, Put, Receive and Transmit from TkbmMWCustomServerTransport and
             TkbmMWCustomClientTransport.
        - Added direct support for DCPCrypt v. 2 in the new TkbmMWDCPCrypt component.
          Add the following definition in kbmMWConfig.inc to add support for it:
          {$DEFINE KBMMW_CRYPT_DCPCRYPT2}                           DCPCrypt 2
          Make sure to download and install DCPCrypt v. 2 Beta 2 from 
            http:  www.cityinthesky.co.uk/cryptography.html
        - Added the following properties to TkbmMWCustomQueryResolver which means they are
          available for resolvers wanting to support those features:
           InsertOnFailedUpdate:boolean - If true will insert if update fails.
           IgnoreFailedInsert:boolean - If true will ignore insert errors.
           IgnoreFailedUpdate:boolean - If true will ignore update errors.
           IgnoreFailedDelete:boolean - If true will ignore delete errors.
           UpdateWhereAll:boolean - If true will use all original fieldvalues as key
                                    when searching for original record instead of
                                    only keyfields.
        - Added protected DisposeCursor:boolean method to TkbmMWCustomPooledCursor which
          controls if the internal cursor returned by PerformQuery etc are disposed after use
          or not. Default is true. Override and set to false if the database adapter
          does not create a new cursor on each PerformQuery, but instead reuses one.
        - Added new kbmMWMT database adapter which allows a central TkbmMemTable to
          be used as a database. The Query property defines the filtering on the
          memtable.
        - Updated all relevant database adapters to support/publish new properties.
        - Published AttachMaxCount and AttachedAutoRefresh properties on all relevant
          database adapters.
        - Updated database adapter wizard to reflect database adapter changes.
        - Updated service wizard to handle 3rdparty services.
        - Added GetExtendable:boolean, GetDescriptionAbstract:string and
          GetDescriptionDetail:string class functions to TkbmMWCustomService.
          They are all used for making the service self describing for the
          service wizard.
        - Added procedure kbmMWRegisterServiceType(AServiceClass:TkbmMWCustomServiceClass),
                procedure kbmMWUpdateServiceType(AServiceClass:TkbmMWCustomServiceClass)
                function kbmMWGetServiceTypeRegistryIndex(AServiceClass:TkbmMWCustomServiceClass):integer
                function kbmMWIsServiceTypeRegistered(AServiceClass:TkbmMWCustomServiceClass):boolean
                procedure kbmMWRegisterServiceTypes(AServiceClasses:array of TkbmMWCustomServiceClass)
                procedure kbmMWUpdateServiceTypes(AServiceClasses:array of TkbmMWCustomServiceClass)
                procedure kbmMWRegisterServices(AServiceClasses:array of TkbmMWCustomServiceClass)  
                procedure kbmMWRegisterService(AServiceClass:TkbmMWCustomServiceClass)
                function kbmMWGetServiceByClassName(AServiceClassName:string):TkbmMWCustomServiceClass;
          for services to register themself for use by the service wizard.
          The servicetype procedures/functions will register service types in the
          registry for use by the wizard.
          The service procedures/functions will add the serviceclass to the list of
          known service classes. 
        - Added Data property of variant type to TkbmMWCustomClient which allows
          sending additional userdefined data to the service called.
          On the server side, the Data can be obtained via the ClientIdent
          argument on the ProcessRequest method and other methods.
          Any settings the server will make to the Data variant will
          be propogated back to the Data property on the client.
        - Added service garbage collection.
        - Added OnGarbageCollect event to TkbmMWServer.
        - Added boolean GarbageCollection property to TkbmMWServer
        - Added integer GarbageInterval property to TkbmMWServer
          Specify interval in seconds.
        - Added parameter MaxIdleTime to RegisterService(s). Set it to 0
          for letting a service instance live forever or to any number of
          seconds the service is allowed to be idle before being garbagecollected.
        - Added LastRequestTime:TDateTime property to TkbmMWCustomService.
          Gives information about when last request was serverd using that
          specific instance.
        - Added StartTime:TDateTime property to TkbmMWCustomService.
          Gives information about when that specific instance was started.
        - Added TotalRequests:integer property to TkbmMWCustomService.
          Gives information about how many requests that specific instance
          have served.
        - Published Params of Indy client transport.
        - Added protected WriteRequest, ReadRequest to TkbmMWCustomRequestTransportStream
        - Added protected WriteResponse and ReadResponse to TkbmMWCustomResponseTransportStream
        - Added dbExpress database adapter.


 0.92a  Changed the license agreement to protect against viral licenses for other libraries.
        Please make sure to read it!
        Added QueryServiceVersion property to client query to supplement the QueryService property.
        Made service name and version not case sensitive when asking for service from client.
        Created new kbmMW service creation wizard.
        Fixed stats not being cleaned from time to time. Added thread checking every 10 secs. to clean.
        Added AutoResolveOnChange to ClientQuery. This will force an automatic resolve after each Post.
        Added AutoResolveOnClose to ClientQuery. This will force an automatic resolve when the dataset
          is closed.
        Made protected properties CurConnections, CurConnectionOwnerIDs and CurRequests public in
        connectionpool. Using those properties information about current number of connections,
        ID's of owners of current request and number of outstanding requests can be obtained.
        Added support for FetchFieldOnDemands on backend database components. Setting it >0
        will request data from backend database in chunks.
        Simplified database adapters.
        Added support for database adapters stored procedure components returning datasets.
        Improved speed fetching data from backend datastore.
        Added GetPublishedQueries to TkbmMWClientQuery. Will return a commatext list of
        names of queries that has been published on the server. Running the actual query
        still require that the client is authorized to do so.
        Replaced MaxStatelessConnections and MaxStateFullConnections with MaxConnections on the
        connection pool. This will break existing code which means all forms/datamodules/services
        where a connection pool is placed needs to be opened in the IDE designer. Ignore any
        errors related to those two properties. Then set the MaxConnections property to
        the desired value and recompile.
        Added experimental support for the ZEOS database library. Thus now there is
        direct support for:
          MSSQL, DB2, Oracle, Progress, MySQL and IB via the Zeos library.
        The Zeos library can be found at: http:  sourceforge.net/projects/zeoslib
        and http:  www.zeoslib.org Please notice that the Zeos library is
        LGPL'ed or GPL'ed. Before using the kbmMW Zeos support files _MAKE SURE_
        to read the new kbmMW license (license.txt).
        Added experiemental support for MySQLDAC from microOLAP (http:  www.microolap.com)
        Added database adapter wizard for creation of new custom database adapters.
        Added GetDescription class function to TkbmMWCustomConnectionPool and all descendants.
        Its purpose is to give a text description of the type of connectionpool.
        Added better automatic reconnection support to client transports via the properties:
        MaxRetries, MaxRetriesAlternative and OnReconnect. This is a step in the direction
        of automatic failover and loadbalancing.

 0.91h  Fixed encryption not fully implemented in kbmMWServer.pas and
        related bug in kbmMWClient.pas.
        Improved kbmMWADOX.pas with regards to resolving and
        connection parameter assignment.
        Extended named query syntax to allow specification of
        client side statement on specified named query.
        Normal syntax: @namedqueryname
        Extended syntax: @namedqueryname@statement
        Added support for client side Execute of query statements in
        addition to opening a query dataset.
        Changed from using ICE (www.nevrona.com) to InnoSetup (www.innosetup.com).

 0.91g  Fixed a M/D event situation when detail memo field was edited and
        the detail data was fetched from cache in client.
        This would result in unexpected eventcalls and detail reload which
        would interfere with the edit mode. Requires kbmMemTable v.3.00f7 Beta
        or newer.

 0.91f  Added Client property to TkbmMWCustomClientDataset and thus to
        TkbmMWClientQuery which allows you to access the actual client
        connection properties like Username and Password and others.
        Fixed small bug where the config flag (kbmMWConfig.inc)
        KBMMW_INDYTCPIP_SUPPORT was not respected.
        Added idTCPServer property to TkbmMWTCPIPIndyServerTransport.
        Added idTCPClient property to TkbmMWTCPIPIndyClientTransport.
        Thus its now possible to go behind the scenes to obtain more
        Indy related information.
        Added VerifyTransfer to client and server transports.
        Published it for Indy client/server transports. If set kbmMW will
        create a verification header which will be verified at arrival.
        If it doesnt match, garbage data was send to the reciepient, and the
        data will be discarded.
        Added new TkbmMWLocalServerTransport and TkbmMWLocalClientTransport for
        allowing a server to have an embedded client.
        Fixed problem when resolving a cached resultset would replace the cached
        resultset with a wrong one. Now instead removes the cached resultset.
        Fixed massive leak in kbmMWBinaryStreamFormat also require update of
        kbmMemTable to v.3.00f6.
        Fixed a few small bugs.

 0.91e  Fixed ADOX exception 'parameter not found' and 'parameter setup invalid'. 

 0.91d  Fixed typo in CopyParamsValueAndType.
        Fixed problems during resolve of client side queries with params.
        Fixed setting the datatype of KBMMW_KEY_ parameters which affected resolving.
        Fixed resetting UpdateStatus of cached datasets.
        Fixed ADOX database adapter.
        Some database types (the BDE f.ex.) require you to set PrependTableName to true
        if any fields contain space in their names.
        Improved Master/Detail support.
        Added RequeryDetail property of TkbmMWClientQuery. Set it to false
        if the complete detail table is fetched and the M/D is done 100% on the client.
        Set it to true if the client should fetch the detail records by querying the server.
        Speed can be improved by enabling caching on the detail table.
        Improved resolving to also update local cache if cache is enabled.
        Added kbmMWConfig.inc which contains descriptions of the kbmMW
        install configuration. Modify it to fit your choise of databases.
        Changed install to a unified install. All database adapters is
        now included in the install. Only the ones enabled in the kbmMWConfig.inc
        file will be available for development.
        Added experimental HTTP streaming support in addition to ZIPPED and STANDARD.
        It will wrap the data with normal HTTP POST/HTTP OK messages.
        In combination with setting the TCPIP port to f.ex. 80 it should
        allow access through a firewall.
        Fixed all database adapters when resolving.
        Fixed datatype 24 (widestring) error during query and resolve.
        Fixed load from briefcase not remembering updatestate of whole dataset.

 0.91c  Fixed TkbmMWCustomPooledQuery.CreateParams not to create multiple
        instances of params having same name.
        Fixed Param not set in query bug when using same paramname several times
        in query.
        Fixed updating key fields on resolve.
        Fixed keeping record position in clientdataset after resolve.
        Fixed date/time in params problems.
        Fixed IBX5 transaction bug.

 0.90b  Added support for FlashFiler 2. 15. Dec. 2001
        Fixed resolving server to client bug when database error occured.
        Requires recompilation of all clients and servers since stream format changed.
        Published Crypt property on IndyTCPIP transport format. Currently only
        crypt component is the TkbmMWEventCrypt which enabled events for encryption
        and decryption. Other components with build in encryption/decryption can
        be derived from TkbmMWCustomCrypt.

 0.90a  Fixed several A/V situations during removal of a component.
        Added support for DBISAM v. 3.xx.
        Added support for IBX v. 5.xx.
        Fixed bug where fkInternalCalc fields didnt get transferred correctly.
        Fixed bug where fieldnames was corrupted while checking for fields to load
        from stream.
        Fixed several other resolving bugs.

 0.90   First public alpha prerelease.  08. Dec. 2001
