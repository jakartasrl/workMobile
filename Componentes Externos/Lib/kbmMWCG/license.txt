All rights reserved.

LICENSE AGREEMENT
-----------------
Before using or evaluating kbmMW you are required to read this license agreement in full,
and agree to its full contents. By starting to use or evaluate kbmMW you have automatically
agreed on the full contents of this license.

All files part of the package are the property of Kim Bo Madsen, Components4Developers.
The ideas and conceptuals are the property of Kim Bo Madsen, Components4Developers
and may not be copied in part or in full.

Although this file _might_ be delivered as an open source file from
Components4Developers, you are not allowed to use it for creating any
applications/projects unless they are strictly for evaluation (of kbmMW)
purposes, unless you obtain a developer license from Components4Developers.
If the content has been delivered as a valid open source file, you are granted an
evaluation period of 14 days from the date you first installed kbmMW components/files in your environment.
Evaluation periods can be extended by _written_ agreement with Components4Developers.

Developer licenses fall in 3 categories:

1) Application specific freeware license. An application specific
   freeware license can be obtained for strictly freeware noncommercial
   applications, and in some situations for commercial charity purposes, but
   only after _written_ agreement with Components4Developers.
   Components4Developers retain the full right to decide if a specific
   project/application require a commerical license or not.

   A freeware license is restricted to a specific application/project and
   to one specific developer only, unless other agreement has been made in
   writing with Components4Developers.

2) Commercial licenses. Commercial licenses _must_ be obtained to use
   these components or any part of kbmMW.

   Unless you have gotten a _written_ agreement with Components4Developers
   about a freeware license, you _must_ purchase one or more commercial licenses.

   A commercial licence is restricted to one and only one specific developer.
   Thus if more or other developers use kbmMW, additional developer
   licenses must be obtained.

3) Free commercial licenses. Free commercial licenses exist for kbmMW CodeGear Edition.
   A free commercial license means that kbmMW CodeGear Edition can be used for free in 
   non open source applications regardless if they are for commercial use or not,
   provided that the applications do not compete against any C4D products at any time,
   and that a notification is sent to sales@components4developers.com about what the
   CodeGear Edition license is used for. No runtime fees apply for the CodeGear Edition license.
   Components4Developers retain the right to use the name of the companies/entities using the 
   CodeGear Edition for PR/reference purposes.

A license is only valid for the specific SKU (CodeGear, Professional or Enterprise)
for which the license originally was obtained. Its not legal to 'borrow' parts
from other licensed SKU levels's to enhance a licensed SKU.

You are not allowed to create developer libraries based on these components
regardless of license choise without prior _written_ agreement with Components4Developers.

You are not allowed to copy source code in parts or full into other
libraries or applications or to distribute source in part or in full.

You are not allowed to copy binary library code in parts or full to other developers.
Other developers must obtain their own license from Components4Developers.

You are not allowed to create competing products using ideas or source from
the components/files which are part of kbmMW or any knowledge gained from
using/browsing the files/components which are part of the kbmMW package.

Copies of the kbmMW package, not obtained _directly_ from Components4Developers
or TurboMiddleware are illegal and therefore not permitted. kbmMW must _not_ be
distributed via any 3rdparty channels, except via Components4Developers or TurboMiddleware.

No part of the kbmMW package may be published in parts or in full unless
a specific permit is granted by Components4Developers.

When, and only when, a valid commercial or freeware license has been obtained,
you are free to distribute your compiled and linked application without
paying royalties for kbmMW. Freeware licenses can contain restrictions to
the number of royalty free copies that can be distributed, unless
specifically agreed in writing with Components4Developers.

kbmMW InControl Management Console and Respository Server installations 
do require runtime licenses and can not be redistributed for free.

At the time of receiving the license for kbmMW, a specified length of Support and Update 
subscription is included with the license. While the subscription is active,
new updates can be fetched, after registration and requesting the license, from the
TurboMiddleware (for CodeGear Edition) (www.turbomiddleware.com) or
MyC4D (for Professional and Enterprise Edition) (www.myc4d.com) portals.
The moment the subscription runs out, the right for newer free updates is automatically revoked.
Additional periods of SAU can be purchased from Components4Developers.
Extensions for SAU are always calculated from the end date of the previous SAU period.

The kbmMW package and files can never be subject to any GPL or LGPL or similar license.
Thus regardless of if you use this library in combination with GPL'ed or LGPL'ed or similar
licensed code, the kbmMW package including all its files, unless Components4Developers has
specifically stated otherwise for specific files, remain being subject _only_ to
the kbmMW license.
Any 3rdparty licenses, regardless if they are viral or not, cannot overrule the kbmMW license.
In case kbmMW is used in an application in combination with libraries which are subject to
the GPL/LGPL or similar viral license the developer/publisher is required to include a text file
specifically stating that kbmMW and all parts theirof are not subject to the GPL/LGPL or
similar viral license. Further no parts of kbmMW sourcecode may be published or included unless
specifically prior written agreement with Components4Developers.

If you find bugs (and optionally fix them) or alter the components, you must make
that change/fix/report available to Components4Developers.
Not doing so violates any obtained license.

License violations, may void your licenses. This is determined case by case
solely by Components4Developers.

Obtaining a license by fraud, or other improper action or by giving misleading
information will automatically void your license.

Using kbmMW for illegal purposes automatically voids your license.

If a license becomes void, all licenses for that specific entity are automatically
void.

When a license becomes void, you are _required_ to remove _ALL_ copies of kbmMW
including all compiled and noncompiled files. You also MUST remove kbmMW
from your applications immediately.

Any ruling by Components4Developers to void a license is final
and cannot be appealed to courts or other authorities.
